## General Information

- Dr. Love will be away from email from 3 PM Friday 2019-11-22 until 9 AM Monday 2019-12-02. 
- TA hours are cancelled for next week, but the TAs will be responding to `431-help` as they can over Thanksgiving week.
- Dr. Love will hold **special office hours** on two dates: 
    - Thursday 2019-11-21 (today) and again on Tuesday 2019-12-03 from 10:00 AM until 12:30 PM and again from 2:30 to 3:30 PM in his office (Wood WG 82-J). 
    - Just stop by if you want to talk - no need for an appointment. 
- I posted to the Quiz page a short note about [how I'll put your three Quiz grades together at the end of the term](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/QUIZZES/README.md#grading-at-the-end-of-the-semester). 
    - I also reposted the [Quiz 2 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ2), correcting a few initial errors in grading questions 6, 11 and 17, and clarifying my mistakes in setting a few questions. You've received an email from me if your grade changed (no one lost any points), and the grading roster should now have all changes incorporated.
- I've pushed the deadline for [Homework I](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/I) to 5 PM on Monday 2019-12-02. See the hints I've posted below, too.
- I [reposted the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/) fixing Section 18.1.5. where I had referred to the old form of `Love-boost.R`.

## Project Portfolio Examples

- For Study A (the Course Survey), [this page links you to everything you need](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_A/EXAMPLE/README.md) to review the Example Portfolio.
    - **HINT** In Analyses 4-6, find (or create) variables with at least 10 observations in each level. Some individual cells may be small as a result. Acknowledge this in interpreting your findings.
- For Study B (your data) [this page links you to everything you need](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_B/EXAMPLE/README.md) to review the Example Portfolio.
    - **CLARIFICATION** I want you to show all of the cleaning steps in your final portfolio (Task 6). So you start there with the raw data, and create the tidy one and codebook within the portfolio (Task 6) at the start, as I did in my example portfolio. In order to prepare the codebook and clean data set that you share in Task 5, you need to do that work that will show up for me in Task 6. So some of Task 6 involves showing me how you got to Task 5.

### Are there any common avoidable mistakes people/groups make while presenting their project to you?

Sure. Here are ten off the top of my head.

1. Trying to hide coding problems from me instead of asking about them a few days (or weeks!) earlier.
2. Not being able to reflect effectively about what they should conclude when their relationship of interest turns out to be weak in these data or that their study design doesn’t provide much power.

3. People who produce lots and lots of unedited, unexplained, unnecessary output (out of fear, I think, that otherwise they’ll be “missing” something.)
4. Not being ready to explain why the code they used is the right thing to do, especially when it doesn’t deviate at all from the sample projects I provided (people who change the code usually have a reason to do so - people who don’t at all worry me.) 
5. Not preparing their documents so that they can easily move from analysis to analysis in Study A or from step to step in Study B when I ask them to do so.
6. Confusing paired vs. independent samples in comparing two means.
7. Not coming to the session with some thoughts on the process of doing the work to share, or coming without a question to ask about how to move the ideas forward.
8. Not attending to the little details (like only loading the packages you’ll actually use, and using the here() package properly, and making sure that all of the elements required are in your portfolio), and producing sloppy work as a result. 
9. Leave time to read through the knitted files after building them - don’t leave things to the last minute.
10. If you’re nervous about the presentation, try explaining your work to another student in the class. Volunteer to do the same for them. If you’re too nervous even for that, try using a rubber duck - it’s an old and valuable debugging trick.

We have limited time, I will want you to focus on some things more than others in your presentation. I steer the presentations pretty quickly if they’re going off course, but also if you've demonstrated your understanding in one area well enough that I want to move on. Don’t be inflexible about this. I want you to demonstrate your progress in lots of ways. I'm hoping you'll all impress me.

## Hints and Help for Homework I ([also available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/HOMEWORK/I/hints.md))

Since we won't hold office hours between 2019-11-23 and 2019-11-30, and we will be responding infrequently to `431-help` during that time, I want to be sure that Homework I goes smoothly. So here are some thoughts in that direction:

1. Question 1 is an essay. You've seen those. 
2. Questions 2-6 involve working with a data set we have provided to fit and evaluate a few multiple regression models.
    - The first hint is already in the R Markdown template. 
        - The strategy for importing the data that it uses requires that you create a subdirectory called R within your project for Homework I. In that data subfolder, put the hwI_plasma.csv data set we have provided.
        - Once you open your R project for Homework I, use here() to figure out where the directory is that R is looking for things, and create the data subdirectory there.
    - Question 2 involves pulling in the data, and then plotting the `betaplasma` variable and then the logarithm of `betaplasma`.
    - Question 3 involves building a model with several predictors, and interpreting its R-square and residual standard error.
    - Question 4 involves estimating the effect of an indicator for female (as compared to male) on your outcome, with a 95% confidence interval.
    - Question 5 asks you to compare two models in terms of adjusted R-square and residual standard error.
    - Question 6 provided you with a link to code to compare the prediction errors made by the two models you've fit.
3. Use the code in the [Study B Example Portfolio](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_B/EXAMPLE/README.md) to help you do what you need to do in Homework I Questions 2-6.
    - Question 2: look at section 9 (step 3), especially sections 9.1 and 9.2 to think about the distribution of the outcome, and section 10 discusses some transformation checking ideas. You don't need Box-Cox in Homework I, specifically, since we won't consider any potential transformations other than the log, but you're welcome to run it and see what it suggests.
    - Question 3: Sections 11 and 12, for instance, discuss and demonstrate model-building.
    - Question 4: Section 11.3, for example, provides ample information on this topic.
    - Question 5: take a look at section 13 (step 7) for some ideas here
    - Question 6: as mentioned in the homework itself, section 14 is the place to go.
4. Look at the code provided in Classes 22-24 in the Slides to help you do that work, as indicated above. I'd probably work directly from the [Class 24 slides](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/CLASSES/CLASS24), since that contains all of the information in one place.
    - Questions 2 and 3 and 5: We did something just like this in Class 23
    - Question 6: We will do this today in Class 24
5. Look closely at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/), where the most relevant Chapters for this work are probably 34-37 and 40.
