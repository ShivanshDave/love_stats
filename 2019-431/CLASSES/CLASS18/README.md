## Upcoming Deadlines

1. [Homework G](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/G) is due at 2 PM Friday 2019-11-01.
    - In some questions, you may want to modify or collapse levels of a factor. You can learn more about this in [the Modifying Factor Levels section of R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html#modifying-factor-levels).
    - I also reframed the presentation of the various types of counties, so as to clarify their exact names in the data set.
2. [Study B Task 4 (Sharing the Raw Data)](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task4b.html) is due on 2019-11-04 at 9 AM via Canvas. 
    - Everyone has now completed Study B Task 3.
3. There will be a Minute Paper after Class 19 due at 2 PM Wednesday 2019-11-06.
4. [Homework H](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/H) is due at 2 PM Friday 2019-11-08.

## R and RStudio Upgrades?

If I had R and RStudio on a machine I controlled, I would upgrade to R version 3.6.1, and also to RStudio version 1.2.5001 or later, as well as upgrading all of my R packages **before** I did the work on my project portfolio. 

- See [our software page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/SOFTWARE) for reminders about installation. 
- If you're using RStudio Cloud, that's OK, too, but you'll have less up-to-date versions of things.

## Discussing the Project Study A (Course Survey) Data

1. The Google Doc codebook folder (which has an updated Google Doc describing each item in detail, and an updated Google Sheet of the items you will receive in the data sets) will remain available at http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-codebook for the rest of the semester. There is a subfolder there called *Data for 2019* that contains some new key pieces of information.
2. [Visit this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_A/get-the-data.md) to get the data.
3. Your first task in building the data you'll need to complete Study A will be to **merge and combine** the five data sets appropriately to produce a complete data set with 67 observations (rows) and 165 columns. All merging and combining of files must be done as part of your R Markdown portfolio for Study A. [At this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_A/merging-advice.md), I provide some advice on doing this merging and combining work.
    - Even if you (somehow) don't need any of the variables in one or more of these files, you will still need to demonstrate that your starting file for Study A has 67 rows and 165 columns, and has been correctly merged and combined.
4. I have also provided a PDF description of the data after it has been correctly merged as part of the *Data for 2019* subfolder in the Google Drive codebook. This is simply the result of running `Hmisc::describe()` on the correctly merged data, plus the results of running `tabyl` on the three items where respondents were asked to "check all that apply." 
    - You'll see that one item (Q-076) showed no variation at all, and thus should not be used in your analyses. It's the question about whether you carry a smart phone. 
    - Several other items, as you'll see, show categories with less than 10 respondents endorsing them. I don't want you to use those variables with collapsing the categories so that all levels have at least 10 respondents. This may, as a result, require you to adjust your analytic plans for Study A.
5. Everyone has now submitted a sufficient version of Study A Task 5 (the Survey Comparison Plan.) Thanks. [I've reviewed them all, and my comments are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_A/comparison-plans.md). Please review what you submitted in light of those comments, and follow the instructions [provided there](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_A/comparison-plans.md).
