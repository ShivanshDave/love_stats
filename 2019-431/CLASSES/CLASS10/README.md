- Six of the stronger essays (written in response to Question 6) [are found here](http://bit.ly/431-2019-hwd-strong-essays).

## Upcoming Deliverables

- [Homework E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/E) is due 2019-09-27 at 2 PM.
    - Interested in knowing what the default colors are in `ggplot2`? Check out [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8197559/emulate-ggplot2-default-color-palette).
- [Project Task 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task1.html) (Scheduling form) is due 2019-09-30 at 9 AM.
    - Thanks to those of you who've already done this. As of 11:30 AM today, I had **29** responses, although at least a couple still need to edit theirs.
- Part A of the Course ends today. We will start Part B on Tuesday.
    - **After** you finish Homework E, if you're using your own installation of RStudio, make sure you've installed everything that is now listed [on the Software Packages page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/PACKAGES.md) (there are new things) then update your packages. 

## Reading?

- I want to be sure that you all know that you can [download the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/index.html#working-with-this-document) in PDF or ePub versions, although you probably want to wait until the end of the semester. Part A is finished today.
- By Tuesday 2019-10-01, you should have read all of Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*.
- By Tuesday 2019-10-08, finish Chapters 4 (Weather predictions) and 5 (Earthquake predictions) of Silver's *The Signal and the Noise*.
- Before taking Quiz 1 (you receive on 2019-10-10) you probably should have read [the Explore section](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/explore-intro.html) (Chapters 2-8) of [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), although I won't be testing you on things in those Chapters that we haven't discussed in class or the class notes or in the homework.
- I also strongly recommend these 7 [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) chapters (although not for Quiz 1, really):
    - [Data import](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html), [Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), [Relational data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html), [Factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html), [Pipes](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html), [R Markdown](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html), and [Graphics for communication](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html)

## New Things

1. [Responses to the Small Group Task from Class 09](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS10/small_group_09_results.md) about identifying minimum and maximum values for proposed quantitative items from the Class Survey for Project Study A.
    - The membership of the small groups [is posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/small_groups.md).
    - Here is my [list of the individual projects and the partnerships](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/project_partners.md) as of now. Check that I have you (and your partner, if any) correctly listed.

2. [Reactions to the Minute Paper after Class 09](http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-09-response) include lots of interesting items, I think. Thanks to you all for participating!

## Want to Improve Your Visualizations?

- The [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd Edition](https://r-graphics.org/), from Winston Chang, is an incredible resource, and is basically how I got hooked on using `ggplot2`. This is full of practical code for accomplishing changes.
    - There's a particularly strong chapter on [Getting Your Data in Order](https://r-graphics.org/chapter-dataprep) which I recommend heartily.

- [Practical ggplot2](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/index.html) from Claus O. Wilke has some amazing step-by-step work through to production-quality examples. Here are three examples:

**[Health Status by Age](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/health_status.html)**

![](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/health_status_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

**[Corruption and Human Development](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/corruption_human_development.html)**

![](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/corruption_human_development_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

and even...

**[Median Income in Texas' Counties](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/Texas_income.html)**

![](https://wilkelab.org/practicalgg/articles/Texas_income_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

Yes, we'll be building maps in 432. Something to look forward to!
