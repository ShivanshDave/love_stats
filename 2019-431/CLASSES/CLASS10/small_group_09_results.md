# Small Group Activity from Class 09

Professor Love asked you to visit http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-survey-first15 with your group and look at six of the items. 

The membership of the small groups [is posted here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/small_groups.md).

As part of the process of posting these items online, we have to tell the computer what values to permit in responses, so we don't have to do quite so much cleanup after people take the survey (and because we cannot walk them through the survey in person.) The population of interest includes the 60 students in the class, plus the seven teaching assistants. Professor Love is **not** answering the survey.

We asked what your group believes we should set as the *minimum* and *maximum* permitted responses. 

## Item 8: In what year were you born?

**Question** What is the key **tradeoff** here? How did the various small groups make that tradeoff in setting their validation limits?
