# 431 Fall 2019 Class 09: 2019-09-24

## Today's Slides

- Class 09 slides are posted in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS09/431_class-09-slides_2019.pdf), as well as [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS09/431_class-09-slides_2019.Rmd) above. 
    - These slides cover material from Chapters 11-13 of the Course Notes.
    - I plan to start these slides today and finish them in Class 10.
- Audio recordings of all Classes are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available.
- To get help, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`.

## Upcoming Deliverables

- There is a [Minute Paper after Class 09](http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-09). Please complete it by Wednesday 2019-09-25 at 2 PM.
    - Among other things, you'll specify the name of your small group (see below).
- [Homework E](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/E) is due 2019-09-27 at 2 PM.
    - Note that the [Homework D Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/HOMEWORK/D/post-deadline.md) is available.
    - If you're planning to skip a Homework (and that's OK - we drop your lowest homework score) then if you can, we'd appreciate it if by the deadline you posted a quick note to Canvas saying "I'm skipping this Homework" so we don't pester you about it.
- [Project Task 1](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task1.html) (Scheduling form) is due 2019-09-30 at 9 AM.
    - Thanks to those of you who've already done this. 
    - As of 2019-09-24 at 9:30 AM, I had 18 responses and I contacted the folks who'd responded from whom I needed clarifications.
    - Remember that you must list at least 9 time slots, and that you must list slots on at least two of the three available days. Failing to do so will leave you drafting a time slot only after all of the people who followed the rules pick first. 
    - If you are unavailable on all of the scheduled dates, indicate that in the comments section of the form, and then contact me directly via email to schedule an earlier presentation.
- I now intend to finish Part A of the course on Thursday 2019-09-26, and start Part B on 2019-10-01. 
    - Quiz 1 covers Part A (Chapters 1-14), as well as anything we discuss in class in August or September.
    - Chapters 1-24 are now available in [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/). 
    - Part B will eventually be Chapters 15-30, roughly.
    - Two new packages, `PropCIs` and `exact2x2` have been added to [the packages list](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/PACKAGES.md), too, as we'll use them in October.

## Merging Two Tables with `join` commands in R

Suppose you have two data sets in R, and you want to merge them together (perhaps they are linked by a subject ID variable, but there are some important variables in one data set, and different ones in another.) This will be something you need to do occasionally, perhaps for the first time in analyzing the survey data in Study A for the Course Project later this semester. I have two resources for you, in addition to the material on [Relational Data in R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html).

- RStudio's [Data Transformation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf) has some descriptions of methods for Combining Tables, with illustrations.
- The [folks at STAT545 have a great "cheat sheet" on this](https://stat545.com/join-cheatsheet.html) as well, which has a more expansive description of some of the ideas.

I've added these suggestions [to the project instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task4a.html#on-merging-the-data-files), as well.

## What is the Midwest?

[We Mapped "the Midwest" for You, So Stop Arguing](https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/08/where-is-the-midwest-map-geography-great-lakes-rust-belt/597082/) by David Montgomery (2019-08-29) at CityLab. 

- This reports on a new survey of more than 12,000 people. Visit http://whatsthemidwest.com/ to participate.

## Formation of Project Study A Small Groups

At 2 PM, you will form a small group of **exactly SIX** people. We should wind up with exactly 10 such small groups.

- If you are working with a partner on the project, your partner needs to be one of the other five members of your small group.

# Today's 2 PM Activity: Forming the Small Groups

0. Create a group of *exactly* six people, and appoint someone with neat handwriting the **recorder** to fill out the sheet of paper.
1. Identify each other by name, and get the recorder to circle the group members' names on the sheet of paper.
2. Create a **name** for your group, and make sure everyone knows it and will spell it the same way on [the Minute Paper](http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-09). Get the reporter to write the group name on the sheet of paper.
3. Visit http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-survey-first15 and look (as a group) at items 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 15. If I wanted to set up the form so that it would reject unreasonable answers to these questions, what should I set as limits? Make some decisions as a group, and get the recorder to write down your groups' proposed minimum and maximum allowable values for these items on the sheet of paper.

The sheet of paper for this activity is also [available as a PDF file above](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS09/431_class_09_small_group_roster_and_activity.pdf).

- As part of the [Minute Paper after Class 09](http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-09), you will specify the name of your group so that I will know who is a member. 
- The small group will work together on [Project Task 2 (Study A)](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2a.html) and [Project Task 3 (Study A)](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task3a.html). Your small group will also work together in class on 2-3 other (ungraded) activities (including the one we'll do today) between now and the end of October.


You will have 15 minutes to do all of this today, so you'll have to be efficient. Turn in the sheet of paper to Professor Love or a TA when you're finished. Thanks!
