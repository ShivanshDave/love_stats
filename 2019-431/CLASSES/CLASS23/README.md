## Project Portfolio Examples

- For Study A (the Course Survey), [this page links you to everything you need](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_A/EXAMPLE/README.md) to review the Example Portfolio.
    - I revised the data02, data03, data04 and data05 data sets, so make sure you grab the new ones. For most of you, this won't matter, but some of you will have an easier time this way. What I did was mostly remove apostrophes from some items.
- For Study B (your data) [this page links you to everything you need](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/STUDY_B/EXAMPLE/README.md) to review the Example Portfolio.

## [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/) updates

- Lots of updates since we last spoke. Grab the latest version, which corrects lots of typos.

## A Few Things To Share

![](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS23/silver20191118.PNG)

- [From @NateSilver538](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1196447398668705792) (CCES is the [Cooperative Congressional Election Study](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/))

- [Physicians and Statistics](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2754781) is a 100 year-old reprint (in JAMA) of a plea for better statistics in medicine. The money quote is probably: "It is probably true that the bulk of medical statistics of the past has been prepared by medical men not trained as expert statisticians." [My source was @RielyMD](https://twitter.com/rielymd/status/1196392547096104961?s=11)

- [More functionality](https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/1196415546327273475) is coming to `patchwork`!

## Something I'm Overly Excited About

[Interactive data tables in R with `reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/index.html), as [highlighted by @Dataandme](https://twitter.com/dataandme/status/1196552930167599106?s=11). Check out the demos!
