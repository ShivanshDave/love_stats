## Today's Slides

- Class 13 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS13/431_class-13-slides_2019.pdf), as well as [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS13/431_class-13-slides_2019.Rmd) above. 
- Audio recordings of all Classes are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available.
- To get help, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`.

## Upcoming Deliverables

- Project Task 2 (Proposal for Study A **and** Proposal for Study B) are due today (2019-10-08) at 5 PM.
    - Here are the instructions [for Part A](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2a.html) and [for Part B](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2b.html).
    - Please visit http://bit.ly/431-2019-task2-review-process for some additional details on the Review and Submission Process for Study A Task 2 and Study B Task 2.
    - Your goal should be to make it easy for us to see what you're planning to do and approve it. To do that, you need to be **incredibly** specific, and write as clearly as possible. Jargon is your enemy. We need explicit specifications of outcome, predictors and data elements. Don't assume we know the science (or whatever) behind your ideas. Get it on the page.
- I've canceled the Minute Paper after Class 13. We'll resume next Wednesday.
- Reading: Finish Chapters 4 (Weather) and 5 (Earthquakes) of *The Signal and the Noise* by 2019-10-10.
- You will receive [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ1) by 5 PM on 2019-10-10. It's due at noon on 2019-10-14. Some [additional details are already posted](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ1).

## Course Notes are now "complete" for 431

On Friday 2019-10-04, I posted Chapters 25-44 of [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/). 

- That not only finishes Part B (Chapters 15-30), but it also gives you Part C (Chapters 31-44).
- I'm sure there are still errors to be fixed and that some details will change a bit over the next two months so I still consider this work in progress, as indicated in the Notes themselves, but I anticipate no additional chapters this term.

## Managing an R Project

Jenny Bryan is the main person I listen to on these and many other issues. Consider:

- [How To Name Files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)
- [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) at tidyverse.org from Jenny Bryan.
    - or try [A Project-Oriented Workflow](https://whattheyforgot.org/project-oriented-workflow.html) from [What They Forgot to Teach You About R](https://whattheyforgot.org/) by Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester.
- [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/r-basics.html) includes an outstanding set of resources to help you work better in R, and do more effective data analysis.

## 2 PM Small Group Activity

You'll return to your [project small groups](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/small_groups.md), where I hope you will complete your work on the [Study Proposal (Task 2) for Project Study A](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2a.html).

Each group shared their Google Doc in progress with me last Thursday or Friday. I reviewed the documents over the weekend and returned them with comments no later than Sunday morning. I sent an email reminding you of the next steps. Each final submission should include no extraneous material and no comments (I want a CLEAN document) and should accomplish the three requirements for Study A Task 2:

1. develop and propose 2-3 “research questions” for Study A (The Class Survey).
2. develop and propose 6-10 “homemade” survey items for Study A that relate to your research questions.
    - The 15 items that have already been chosen for the Survey are at http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-survey-first15.
3. identify and propose a “scale” of items for Study A (The Class Survey).

Be sure your names are all on the document, along with your group name, too. Use this time to finish up your responses to my comments and make whatever adjustments you deem necessary before submitting the final work (remember it is due at 5 PM today.) Thanks!
