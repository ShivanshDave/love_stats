    - Here are the instructions [for Part A](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2a.html) and [for Part B](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2b.html).

    - Your goal should be to make it easy for us to see what you're planning to do and approve it. To do that, you need to be **incredibly** specific, and write as clearly as possible. Jargon is your enemy. We need explicit specifications of outcome, predictors and data elements. Don't assume we know the science (or whatever) behind your ideas. Get it on the page.
- Reading: Finish Chapters 4 (Weather) and 5 (Earthquakes) of *The Signal and the Noise* by 2019-10-10.
- You will receive [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ1) by 5 PM on 2019-10-10. It's due at noon on 2019-10-14. Some [details are already posted](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ1).

## Two Quick Things

1. Have someone in your project small group visit the Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/431-2019-who-will-submit-task2 and tell me who will submit Study A Task 2 for your group, so I know who to chase if there's an issue. Thank you. 

2. Thank you to those of you who confirmed your project presentation arrival time. The people who aren't yet confirmed are in bold on [the Project Schedule page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT/SCHEDULE), and received an email from me today asking them to confirm their time. If you got such an email, please reply to me confirming your arrival time. Thanks.

3. Someone asked about what my file structure looks like. For meaningful projects, I have something like this:

```
431_FALL2019
    |
CLASS12
    |
    ---- data
    ---- R
    ---- results
    ---- images
```

with the .RProj file in CLASS12, the .csvs and other data in "data", .R and .Rmd in "R", .png and .jpg in images, finished slides in `results`, etc.

For a research project, I usually subfolder within `data` to:

```
data
   |
   ----- raw
   ----- merged
   ----- clean
```

## Minute Paper Feedback

- [Comments on the Minute Paper after Class 11](http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-11-response) are now available.

## The Play I'm In

Since some people have asked, the play I'm in is called *Noises Off* by Michael Frayn. It's a farce, and it's being performed by the Hudson Players on November 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 16 and 17. Tickets [are available here](https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?actions=4&p=1). If you want a few more details, you can [visit my theater page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/README.md).

### If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

Good heavens, no. I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## 2 PM Small Group Activity

You'll return to your [project small groups](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/small_groups.md). Please work on your [Study Proposal for Project Study A](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2a.html), which must be completed by 5 PM next Tuesday. One member of your group will share a Google Doc directly with me (and each other) to:

1. develop and propose 2-3 “research questions” for Study A (The Class Survey).
2. develop and propose 6-10 “homemade” survey items for Study A that relate to your research questions.
    - The 15 items that have already been chosen for the Survey are at http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-survey-first15.
3. identify and propose a “scale” of items for Study A (The Class Survey).

If you need ideas, the [old surveys from 2014-2018 are here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT#special-links). In the meantime, let us know how we can help, beyond what is already posted in [the instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-project/task2a.html). 

The Study B proposal is also due on Tuesday 2019-10-08 at 5 PM. That proposal is submitted to Canvas.
