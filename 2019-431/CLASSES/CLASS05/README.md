# 431 Fall 2019 Class 05: 2019-09-10

## Today's Slides

- Class 5 slides will be available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS05/431_class-05-slides_2019.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS05/431_class-05-slides_2019.Rmd) above. 
- Audio recordings of all Classes are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available.
- To get help, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`.

## As you arrive today, take an index card...

On the index card, write down (so that someone else can *read it without help*) the most important/interesting/surprising thing you learned from reading the four chapters of Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*. Chapter 5 is about Exploratory Analysis, Chapter 9 is about Written Analyses, Chapter 10 is about Creating Figures and Chapter 13 highlights a few matters of form.

- One sentence is plenty.
- If you cannot limit yourself to one thing, try to keep it to two.
- Later in today's class (about 2 PM), you'll share these with a colleague, and at the end of class, you'll hand your card to a TA.

## Reminders

1. The Answer Sketch for Homework B [is available now](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/HOMEWORK/B/post-deadline.md). Grades will appear Thursday.
2. There is a [Minute Paper](http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-05) to complete after today's class. The link is http://bit.ly/431-2019-minute-05.
3. [Homework C](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/C) is due Friday 2019-09-13 at 2 PM.
4. By now, you should have read Chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13 (at least) from Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*. We expect you to have finished reading that book by 2019-10-01.
5. Please read the Introduction and Chapter 1 of Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* by 2019-09-17.

## The Course Project

A nearly-complete draft of Course Project instructions [is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/README.md).

- We'll take questions starting after class at `431-help`, or in the Minute Paper, or we'll take them in class, as well, starting Thursday, so that everyone can read the instructions first.

### First Steps on the Project

You will do much of the project work in October and November, but it's never too early to get started.

- Read the [instructions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/PROJECT/README.md) soon. 
    - The main thing that's not complete is the information on deadlines. 
    - All project deadlines will be settled and posted by 2019-09-17.
- By the start of class on 2019-09-24, you need to know the answer to "Will I work alone, or with a partner?"
- By 2019-09-30, you (and your partner, if you have one) must finish the [Project Scheduling Form](http://bit.ly/431-2019-project-scheduling).
- In early October, you will need to identify and register a Study B data set that matches our specifications. You would ideally have the data in R by then, but if not, you **must** have it in your hands no later than 2019-10-31.

## A Few Items of Interest

1. [Here's a tweet containing a GIF from @NicholasStrayer](https://twitter.com/nicholasstrayer/status/1026893778404225024) on how much trouble you can get into with building histograms with poor choices of bin width or number of bins, from 2018-08-07. 
    - The [rest of the stream](https://twitter.com/nicholasstrayer/status/1026893778404225024) includes tools for building these yourself, and an interactive, too.
2. Jesse Maegan's [Data Science and R: How do I start?](https://medium.com/@kierisi/data-science-and-r-how-do-i-start-7a87426e103e) might be very helpful for those of you needing a boost of confidence, especially.
3. **Colors**.
    - My favorite [Colors in R](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) reference is http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf
    - CWRU's color branding guidelines (if you need them) are at https://case.edu/umc/our-brand/visual-guidelines/color.
    - Some googling led me to [Cleveland Clinic's color palette](https://onbrand.clevelandclinic.org/explore-the-guidelines/brand-guidelines/colors/) and to [University Hospitals' branding standard](https://www.uhhospitals.org/brand/uh-brand-center), for example.
    - If you're a sports fan, perhaps Cleveland's [Major League Baseball](https://teamcolorcodes.com/cleveland-indians-color-codes/), [National Football League](https://teamcolorcodes.com/cleveland-browns-color-codes/) or [National Basketball Association](https://teamcolorcodes.com/cleveland-cavaliers-color-codes/) team colors are of interest. [Team Color Codes](https://teamcolorcodes.com/) is an excellent reference.

## On NHANES

- Today's analyses use data from NHANES (the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).) A closely related example also using NHANES data is discussed in Chapters 3-6 of [the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/).
