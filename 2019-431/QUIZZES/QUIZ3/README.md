## Materials for taking the Quiz

Quiz 3 materials are NOW AVAILABLE. [This link goes to a shared Google Drive folder](http://bit.ly/431-2019-quiz3-folder) where you will find:

- the PDF of the Quiz itself, which is called `2019-431-quiz03-questions.pdf`,
- subfolders called 
    - `data` containing data sets, and 
    - `R` containing the `Love-boost.R` script and a snippet of code I'm providing for one of the questions, and
- a Google Doc called "Where do I find the Quiz 3 Answer Sheet to fill out?" that contains a link to the Answer Sheet (Google Form) where you will submit your responses.

# Quiz Instructions (from the PDF)

The **deadline** for completing the Answer Sheet is 2019-12-12 at Noon, and this is a firm deadline, without a grace period. 

There are 20 questions on this Quiz. The maximum score is 100 points, with each question's value  indicated below. A blank response will automatically receive zero credit, which is the lowest possible score on a question, so you should answer all questions, even if you have to guess.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz on the Answer Sheet and then return later, you can do this by:

1. completing the final question which asks you to type in your full name, and then 
2. submitting the Answer Sheet. 

You will then receive a link which allows you to return to the Answer Sheet without losing your progress.

Occasionally, I ask you to provide code. In all cases, a single line of code is sufficient, and it can include at most one pipe for these purposes, although you may or may not need the pipe in any particular setting. Moreover, you need not include the `library` command at any time for any of your code. Assume in all questions that all relevant packages and data sets have been loaded in R. Any reference to a logarithm refers to a natural logarithm. If you need to set a seed, use `set.seed(2019)` throughout the Quiz.

You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on Quiz 3 with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants at 431-help at case dot edu. Please submit any questions you have about the Quiz to 431-help through email. Thank you, and good luck.
