# 431 Quizzes

There will three quizzes this term.

## General Thoughts

Each Quiz will be taken online, exclusively. 

**If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible**, at least a week before a Quiz is released.

### About the Quizzes

1. Quizzes typically involve 25-35 questions. I aim for 30.
2. The questions are not arranged in any particular order, and you should answer all questions.
3. All questions involve relatively short responses, sometimes after working through a detailed analysis.
4. You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the deadline.
5. You are welcome (even encouraged) to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are **not** allowed to discuss the questions on the Quizzes with anyone other than Professor Love or the teaching assistants.
6. We do not guarantee to answer questions we receive via email less than 3 hours prior to the Quiz submission deadline.
7. Quizzes should not be late, and lateness will not be tolerated well, except in truly remarkable circumstances.
8. An answer sketch for each Quiz will be made available within 48 hours of the deadline. 
9. Grades for the Quizzes are usually available within 48 hours of the deadline. 
10. If you feel Professor Love has made an error in grading your Quiz, please let him know directly, by email, as soon as possible.

## Grading at the end of the semester

At the end of the term, you'll have grades on three quizzes, all on a scale of 0-100. Call your best score A, your middle score B and your worst score C. To get your Quiz average for the course, we'll take (3A + 3B + 2C) and divide the result by 8. That will down-weight your worst score a little bit relative to the other Quizzes.
