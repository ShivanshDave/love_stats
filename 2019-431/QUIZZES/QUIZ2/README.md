# Quiz 2

## After the Quiz

- The [answer sketch is now available](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ2/2019-431-quiz02-sketch.pdf). 
  - I updated the answer sketch after class to reflect a change in how I graded Question 11. If you were affected, I emailed you Tuesday to tell you about the points you gained. No one lost any points due to this change.
- Grades on the Quiz are now posted to the usual roster at http://bit.ly/431-2019-grades.

### Grading Details

Sum up your scores on the 30 items. That's your raw total. Add 8.5 points. That's your Quiz 2 score.

Quiz 2 score | Rough "Grade" | n
-----------: | :------------: | --:
95 and higher | strong A | 11
90 to 94.5 | A | 10
85 to 89.5 | A- | 7
80 to 84.5 | B+ | 13
75 to 79.5 | B | 10
70 to 74.5 | B- | 1
below 70 | worse | some

For those of you with a Quiz 2 score more than a point or two below 75, I'm some degree of concerned about your score on the Quiz.

[At the shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16yVGVJKvlpnu5SjisTAmfudkdoMEvm3P?usp=sharing), you will find:

- Quiz 2 is primarily about Chapters 15-28 (and 30) of the Course Notes. It also covers material from Chapters 1-14 of those Notes, as well as Chapters 1-11 of Nate Silver's *The Signal and the Noise* and all of Jeff Leek's *Elements of Data Analytic Style*.

## Here is the instructions page from the Quiz itself:

All of the links for Quiz 2 Materials are at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/QUIZZES/QUIZ2.

### The Materials

To complete the Quiz you'll need three things, all of which are linked at the URL above.

1. The `2019-431-quiz02-questions.PDF` file. This contains all of the instructions, questions and potential responses. Be sure that you see all 30 questions, and all 27 pages.

2. Five data files, named `quiz_data_states.csv`, `quiz_hosp.csv`, `quiz_ra.csv`, `quiz_sim_nejm.csv` and `quiz_statin.csv`, which may be useful to you.

3. The **Quiz 2 Answer Sheet** which is a Google Form. 

Use the PDF file to read the quiz and craft your responses (occasionally making use of the provided data sets), and then place those responses into the Answer Sheet. When using the Answer Sheet, please select or type in your best response (or responses, as indicated) for each question. All of your responses must be in the Answer Sheet by the deadline.

### Key Things To Remember

The **deadline** for completing the Answer Sheet is Noon on Monday 2019-11-18, and this is a firm deadline, without the grace period we allow for in turning in Homework. 

The questions are not arranged in any particular order, and your score is based on the number of correct responses, so you should answer all questions. There are **30** questions, and each is worth either 3 or 4 points. The maximum possible score on the quiz is **100** points. Questions 01, 02, 05, 06, 08, 14, 17, 22, 27 and 30 are worth 4 points each. They are marked to indicate this.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz on the Answer Sheet Google Form and then return later, you can do this by [1] completing the final question which asks you to type in your full name, and then [2] submitting the Answer Sheet. You will then receive a link which allows you to return to the Answer Sheet without losing your progress.

Occasionally, I ask you to provide a single line of code. In all cases, a single line of code can include at most one pipe for these purposes, although you may or may not need the pipe in any particular setting. Moreover, you need not include the library command at any time for any of your code. Assume in all questions that all relevant packages have been loaded in R. Any reference to a logarithm refers to a natural logarithm. If you need to set a seed, use `set.seed(2019)` throughout this Quiz.

You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants at 431-help at case dot edu. Please submit any questions you have about the Quiz to 431-help through email. Thank you, and good luck.
