## General Instructions for Quiz 1

LAST UPDATE 2019-10-06 10:00 PM

Please select or type in your best response (or responses, as indicated) for each question. 

The deadline for completing the Quiz is NOON on Monday 2019-10-14, and this is a firm deadline, without the grace period we allow for in Homework assignments.

The questions are not arranged in any particular order. Your score is based on the number of correct responses, so there's no chance a blank response will be correct, and a guess might be, so you should definitely answer all of the questions.

20 of the main **30** questions on the Quiz are worth 3 points each. The remaining ten questions are worth 4 points each and they are marked to indicate this. (The four-point questions are: 2, 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, 20, 22, 28 and 30.) That makes a total of 100 points available. There is also a 2-point optional bonus question, marked as Question 19X, so that the actual maximum possible score is 102, but we will treat this as a 100 point Quiz.

If you wish to work on some of the quiz and then return later, you can do this by [1] completing the final question (the affirmation) which asks you to type in your full name, and then [2] submitting the quiz. You will then receive a link at your CWRU email which will allow you to return to the quiz as often as you like without losing your progress.

There are materials for you related to Questions 10, 17-19 and 22, including two data files (`dat10.csv` and `dat22.csv`) provided for you as part of the Quiz 1 materials for the course on our web site. (*You'll find them at the bottom of this page when the time comes.*)

A PDF printout of the complete Quiz 1 Google Form is also available to you on our course web site, but all of your answers must be returned using the Google form, and not anything else.

Occasionally, I ask you to provide a single line of code. In all cases, a single line of code can include at most one pipe for these purposes, although you may or may not need the pipe in any particular setting. Moreover, you need not include the library command at any time for any of your code. Assume in all questions that all relevant packages have been loaded in R.

You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants and you must do so by sending an email to 431-help at case dot edu. That way, we can track what's been asked. We will not guarantee that questions received after 9 AM on Monday 2019-10-14 will be answered in a timely fashion, but otherwise, we will try to keep up.

Thank you, and good luck.
