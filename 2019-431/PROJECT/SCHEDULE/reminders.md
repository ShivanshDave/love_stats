# Text of the email I will send out each evening to students giving their projects the next day

Hi - 

Please remember to arrive at my office Wood WG 82-J at the time listed below. 

- Make sure you have your laptop working, and that your HTML file (and, if you have one, your Powerpoint file) are up and running on your laptop before you come in to my office.
- If the door is open please come in as soon as you (and your laptop) is ready. **Don't** wait - if at all possible, I'd like to get you in (and out) a little early, and reduce the transition time between groups.
- If the door is closed, have a seat nearby, and get ready, so that when you see the door open, you can come right in.

1. I'll be making notes occasionally during your presentation. Sometimes that's about you and your grade, sometimes it's about something I want to check in your project portfolio and sometimes it's about something else, so don't worry if I write a lot, a little or barely at all during your presentation.
2. I'll be timing us, so you don't have to. I will move you along during the presentation so we use the time well.
3. At the beginning of the session, I'll ask you to pronounce your name (or names) for me, and we'll start with the Analysis in Study A (of the six that you did) that you want to share with me the most. Then I'll pick another one of the six for you to share, as well. Then we'll move on to Study B.
4. At the end of the session, I will ask you three questions:Of all of the time you spent doing project B after you had an approved proposal, some was spent on getting the data ready (gathering, managing and cleaning the data) and then the rest was spent on what I'll call analysis for the moment. What percentage of your time on Project B was spent doing the data management and cleaning - that is, on the work you did before your analysis?What was the hardest (or most difficult) thing to do during this project?What was the most important (or useful) thing you learned doing this project?
5. After our meeting is over, I hope you'll fill out the course evaluation that CWRU has asked you to complete.

Below this, I'll print that day's schedule, with the Arrive At time highlighted.

I'm looking forward to your talks. I wish you all an excellent presentation.
