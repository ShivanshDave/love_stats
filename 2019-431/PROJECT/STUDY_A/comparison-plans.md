# Comments on Task 5: Survey Comparison Plan

## Frequently Asked Questions

1. Do my study A comparisons have to follow a central theme?
    - No.
2. Can I change my mind later in the term about what I want to study?
    - Yes.
3. If I do change plans for my Study A from this point forward, how do I let you know that?
    - In your Task 6 (portfolio) and Task 7 (presentation) in December.
    - If you are unsure whether your new idea works or not, ask us at `431-help`.
4. If I have comparisons planned which don't work out, do I have to amend my plan, and then show it to you?
    - No. You'll just present what you finally settle on in Tasks 6 and 7. I don't want to see revisions to Task 5. This is a change from the original plan, but I trust you all to figure out what isn't working, or to ask us about it at `431-help`.
5. What am I supposed to do?
    - Look at the rest of this document, and verify that your plans are OK. If they aren't, make new plans. If you're not sure your new plans are right, then ask us at `431-help` or in TA office hours. You're going to want to have all of this completely clear before you come close to taking Quiz 2.
    - If you need a quantitative variable, I suggest one of the scale summaries. Or pick a quantitative variable no one else is using.
    - If you need a multi-categorical variable, I suggest one of the scale categories. Or pick a multi-categorical variable no one else is using.
    - If you need a binary variable, I suggest you look at the Codebook's Description Google Sheet, which lists all of them, and pick one of interest that no one else is using.

## Comments on Analysis 1

32 projects said they would use independent samples, and 11 said they will use paired samples.

1. These folks said they were doing independent samples, but then posted values in A and B (which are for paired samples)
    - Roche, Miller, Siuba, Tsuang

2. Paired Samples Plans included the following choices which at least use the same units so paired differences make some sense.
    - Q056 vs. Q058
    - Q035 vs. Q037
    - Q056 vs. Q057
    - Q087 vs. Q088
    - Q060 vs. Q061
    - Q065 (converted to minutes) vs. Q088

3. Paired Samples Plans also included the following choices which do not use the same units and will not be acceptable...
    - Q047 vs. Q058
    - Q031 vs. Q033
    - Q041 vs. Q042
    - Q041 vs. Q070
    - Q039 vs. Q086

4. Independent Samples Outcomes (specified as variable C) need to be quantitative. Here are the quantitative variables people suggested they would use, all of which are at least plausible.
    - Body Mass Index (includes Q-011 height and Q-012 weight)
    - Perceived Stress Scale summary score
    - Q010, Q011, Q012, Q013, Q031, Q033, Q035, Q057, Q058, Q059, Q060, Q064, Q065, Q066, Q069, Q087, and Q088
    
5. Independent Samples Outcomes that were suggested as variable C, but aren't quantitative, so they won't work.
    - Q027 (only 8 different values observed)
    - Q046 (that's a categorical variable)
    
6. Independent Samples Two-Level Factors (variable Z) need to actually be binary, or you need to specify that you're going to categorize something into two groups explicitly with each level including a minimum of 10 subjects. Plausible choices made by students included:
    - Q001, Q003, Q006, Q016, Q018, Q022, Q043, Q045, Q050, Q051, Q055 (collapsed to own a pet - yes/no), Q071.  
    - Some people suggested things that will work but only if divided into two categories sensibly (likely with a *median split*) and these were: Q033, Q064, Q088
    
7. Variable Z (independent samples two-level categories) that actually will not work included:
    - Q007 (only 9 people said yes)
    - Q023 (only 6 people said yes)
    - Q044 (only 5 people said yes)

Again, remember that all categorical variables used in your analyses require a minimum of 10 subjects in each level.

## Comments on Analysis 2

1. Planned Quantitative Variables (outcome D) that have the potential to work:
    - Body Mass Index (includes Q-011 height and Q-012 weight)
    - Perceived Stress Scale summary score
    - Q012, Q013, Q015, Q031, Q032, Q033, Q035, Q036, Q038, Q042, Q057, Q058, Q059, Q060, Q061, Q064, Q065, Q066, Q069, Q086, Q087, Q088 and Q089

2. Variables specified for outcome D that won't work:
    - Q016 (which is binary, not quantitative)

3. Planned choices of factor Y (which need to have 3-6 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive levels) that have the potential to work:
    - These can work as is: Q054, Q077, 
    - These can work if you collapse them to 3-6 levels so that each level has 10+ values: Q009, Q024, Q025, Q026, Q028 (I think), Q029 (but it's tricky), Q046, Q052, Q055 (but again it's tricky), Q078, Q079, PSS-03, PSS-06 (although for the PSS folks, why not just use the PSS category?)
    - These are quantitative, but could be split into 3-6 groups of size 10+: Q037, Q059, 

4. Planned choices of factor Y that will not work:
    - Q005 (binary)
    - Q074 (binary)
    - Q081 (not enough people selected Rural)
    - Q082 (not enough people selected hardcore)
    
## Comments on Analysis 3

1. Choices of Quantitative Variable G that have the potential to work:
    - Q011, Q015, Q031, Q032, Q033, Q034, Q035, Q038, Q041, Q042, Q047, Q056, Q057, Q061, Q063, Q064, Q067, Q068+Q069, Q085, Q086, Q087, Q088, SDG-01, SDG-25 (although I would perhaps combine SDG-24 and SDG-25)
    
2. Choices for Variable G that will not work:
    - FCS scale score (not enough possible levels to justify calling this quantitative, unfortunately)

## Comments on Analysis 4

1. Planned factor L needs to have exactly 2 levels with at least 10 observations in each level, as does factor M. Plausible choices made by students:
    - Actually binary questions with at least 10 observations at each level, including Q001, Q002, Q003, Q004, Q005, Q006, Q016, Q017, Q018, Q020, Q022, Q043, Q045, Q048, Q049, Q050, Q051, Q071, Q072, Q073, Q074, FCS-1, FCS-2.
    - Quantitative variables that can be split (probably at the median) into two groups, including Q015, Q031, Q056, Q064, Q088.
    - Multi-categorical variables that can be collapsed down to two levels, including Q024, Q027, Q046, Q055 (but it would be tricky), Q062, PSS-04.
    
2. Planned two-level factors (L or M) that won't work:
    - Q007 (only 9 respondents said Yes)
    - Q023 (only 6 Yes)
    - Q044 (only 5 Yes)

## Comments on Analyses 5 and 6

Here, you need multi-categorical factors, with (in factor J) 2-6 levels or (in factors K or N) 3-6 levels that are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive and have at least 10 respondents at each level. You could have used anything that meets this standard, but I'm going to stop here, and let you think this through.

- If you suggested a quantitative measure for one of these factors, that can work, but only if you split the variable into 3-6 groups that meet the requirements.
- If you suggested a multi-categorical variable, be sure that you collapse it (if necessary) to create 3-6 levels with at least 10 people in each level.
- If you suggested a binary variable, that will work for J, but not for K or N.

I didn't look at the backups you suggested, but they'd follow the same logic that I applied above.

Good luck!
