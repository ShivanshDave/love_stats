# Course Project Example for Study A

This page links to a demonstration of the sorts of analyses we are asking you to complete for your project Study A (using the class survey.)  

## Accessing the Materials

HTML and R Markdown versions, along with the data used to build the examples, will be available at the Shared Google Drive folder you can access (after logging into Google via CWRU) at http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-example.

## The Data

The data are in the `survey2015raw_a.csv` and `survey2015raw_b.csv` data files available on the [Data and Code page of our website](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431-data), as well as in the [Shared Google Drive folder](http://bit.ly/431-2019-studyA-example) mentioned above.

## Is there an example for Project Study B, too?
