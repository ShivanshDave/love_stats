- The answer sketch is now available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/HOMEWORK/C/sketch_C.pdf), and [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/HOMEWORK/C/sketch_C.Rmd).
- Grades on Homework C were posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-grades on 2019-09-19.
    - Remember that you will need the Homework ID code Dr. Love provided to you via email on 2019-09-05 to identify your results.
    - If you wish to have Professor Love regrade this homework, he does those in a batch at the end of the semester. Request regrades by visiting http://bit.ly/431-2019-regrade-requests at any time before noon on 2019-12-12.

## Hint I Provided via email

I want to know if you can answer Questions 4-7 using a histogram and (really) a histogram alone in terms of a graph plus a few of the basic numerical summaries which you can obtain from (for example) the favstats function from the mosaic package. A boxplot (+/- a violin plot) or even a stem-and-leaf might be of some help, too, for Question 6, mostly.

In Question 5, I intend for you to compare the mean to the median of the distribution. If the mean is substantially larger than the median, this would indicate right skew. If the mean is substantially smaller than the median, this would indicate left skew. One way to measure this is to consider whether the mean is more than 20% of a standard deviation away from the median - if so, that would be a very clear indication of substantial skew in the appropriate direction.

In Question 7, I mean for you to respond to the question by looking at the histogram (or perhaps a boxplot or violin plot, but the histogram should be sufficient) and explaining why (or why not) you believe you could use a Normal distribution (and its bell-shaped curve) to model these data effectively. I am not looking for a statistical test, or for you to superimpose a potential Normal curve on top of that histogram, for example, and doing this could be fine, but could also lead you down a rabbit hole of code problems that will waste a lot of your time. 

I will provide substantial additional guidance regarding other things that could be done in the answer sketch, but what we're looking for in grading Homework C is actually a pretty straightforward interpretation of a histogram in Questions 4-7.
