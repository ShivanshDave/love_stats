["course-description.html", "Section 1 Course Description 1.1 What Students Should Expect 1.2 431 Class Outline 1.3 Key Topics in 431 and 432 1.4 What We Expect You To Know Already 1.5 R and RStudio 1.6 Pep Talk! (Thanks, Andrew Heiss) 1.7 Why I Teach 431 Like This", " Section 1 Course Description PQHS 431 (cross-listed as CRSP 431 and MPHP 431) is the first half of a two-semester sequence (with 432) focused on modern data analysis and advanced statistical modeling, with a practical bent and as little theory as possible. We emphasize the key role of thinking hard, and well, about design and analysis in research. The course is formally titled Statistical Methods in Biological &amp; Medical Sciences, Part 1. A more accurate title is Data Science for Biological, Medical or Health Research. We’ll learn about managing and visualizing data, building models and making predictions, and other data science activities. This highly applied course focuses on modern tools for learning from data. We’ll learn a lot of R, and we’ll use RStudio and R Markdown as tools to help make R work better, and help perform our research in replicable ways. 1.1 What Students Should Expect During the 431-432 sequence, students will: Use modern data science tools to import, tidy/manage, explore (through transformation, visualization and modeling) and communicate about data. Think hard and well about design and analysis in scientific research. Gain sufficient background in the practical issues regarding linear and generalized linear models to give you a starting place for meaningful applied work, particularly in terms of making comparisons to address general types of statistical and analytic questions (exploratory, predictive, inferential, and causal, in particular.) Learn about the importance of replicable research, and develop facility and practice in open source tools for doing it. Complete a series of assignments, including homeworks and quizzes on data provided for you, and course projects using data you select/develop. Program (“Code”) in R sufficiently to accomplish the tasks above, with enough self-sufficiency afterwards to be able to debug and use new R tools without substantial troubleshooting help. What separates “doing data science” from “doing data analysis” is programming. 1.2 431 Class Outline The 431 course calendar is linked at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431. Go there for details on each class throughout the semester. The course is split in three parts. Part A (Classes 2-10) is mostly about R and Visualizing Data. Exploratory Data Analysis Descriptive Numerical and Graphical Summaries Distributions, specifically the Normal Histograms and their cousins Scatterplots and related tools from correlation and linear regression Exploring Data with the Tidyverse, Getting Up To Speed with R Visualizing Data with ggplot2 Data Transformation and dplyr Using scripts and projects, Building Code Part B (which starts around Class 11) is about Making Comparisons. Estimation and Inference for Means and Proportions Confidence Intervals Design Implications: Matched vs. Independent Samples Hypothesis Testing Strategies Cross-Tabulations Dealing with Missing Data Randomized Trials vs. Non-Randomized Studies Part C (which starts around Class 16) is about Building Regression Models. Estimation and Inference using Ordinary Least Squares Categorical Variables, Analysis of Variance Simple and Multivariate Linear Regression Models Building Prediction Models, and Validating Them Analysis of Covariance Residual and Influence Analyses Foundations of Model / Feature / Variable Selection 1.3 Key Topics in 431 and 432 Exploratory Data Analysis: “All graphs are comparisons” including data exploration, statistical graphics and more general visualization of information. Placing biological, medical and health research questions into a statistical framework. Study Development - making choices in designing and executing the collection and aggregation of data. Data Handling - including important issues in importing, tidying and transforming data, as well as methods for dealing with missing data, including imputation. Statistical Comparisons: “All of statistics are comparisons” - including methods for discrete and continuous variables: intervals, assumptions, some thoughts on statistical power, and the bootstrap, design of visualizations and models for rates, proportions and contingency tables. The proper use of multi-predictor models for continuous and discrete data, including… Fitting, evaluating, and interpreting linear and generalized linear models. Prediction and validation. Critical role of graphics, including diagnostics and residual analysis. Model choice, including variable selection, shrinkage and model uncertainty. Dealing with categorical predictors and interactions meaningfully. Causal inference using regression: controlling for covariates meaningfully. Using R and RStudio to make all of the things above happen; with particular emphasis on doing replicable research and using Markdown to document the work. 1.4 What We Expect You To Know Already Not much. Useful prior experience includes training/experience in statistics, coding/programming and biology/biomedical science. We expect most people will have some experience in one or two of these areas, but very few will have all three. Some students have lots of prior training in statistics. But there are many students in the class with no statistical training at all that they use regularly. We assume only that everyone knows what an average is, and has some sense of why statistics might be useful to them in their chosen field. Some students have lots of prior coding and programming experience, including experience with R. Some have never written a line of code in their life. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn how to do modern work with data, and that means writing computer code, but that some people will be starting from nothing. Some students have lots of prior experience with biological and biomedical science, and know a lot of useful things in those areas which relate directly to our work. Others have zero experience in this area, and will learn a lot from their colleagues. We assume only that everyone is willing to learn, and to put in some effort to do so. People succeed in this course with a wide range of backgrounds and a common interest in using data effectively in research related to biology, health or medicine. There will be multiple people in the class who are years away from their last statistics class. We expect the majority of students will have no prior experience using R, or any meaningful recollection of using statistical software. The pace can be brisk at times, but all CWRU students who feel up to it are welcome, regardless of their field of study or prior experience. 1.5 R and RStudio (borrowed from Andrew Heiss) You will do all of your analysis with the open source (and free!) programming language R. You will use RStudio as the main program to access R. Think of R as an engine and RStudio as a car dashboard. R handles all the calculations and the actual statistics, while RStudio provides a nice interface for running R code. R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for some of your work, too. RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis. Over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. This isn’t absolutely necessary early on, but you’ll probably feel the need to have done it by the end of September. You’ll find complete instructions for installing, R, RStudio, the R packages we’ll use and the data and code we’ve built for 431 here. 1.6 Pep Talk! (Thanks, Andrew Heiss) Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new lanugage, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham-the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like ggplot2 made this wise observation: It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions at 431-help at case dot edu, e-mail Dr. Love, etc. I promise you can do this. 1.7 Why I Teach 431 Like This I have a lot of thoughts on this issue, but you may prefer to hear from other people on the subject. So here are a few references that have guided my recent thinking. A Guide to Teaching Data Science by Stephanie C. Hicks, Rafael A. Irizarry (pdf) … our (case-study) approach (in a graduate-level, introductory data science course) teaches students three key skills needed to succeed in data science, which we refer to as creating, connecting, and computing. Data Visualization on Day One: Bringing Big Ideas into Intro Stats Early and Often by Xiaofei Wang, Cynthia Rush, Nicholas Jon Horton (pdf) 50 Years of Data Science by David Donoho in the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 2017. Why You Should Master R (Even if it might eventually become obsolete) blog post from Sharp Sight, 2016-12-27 Teaching R to New Users - From tapply to the Tidyverse by Roger D. Peng, which is also available as a YouTube Video Teach the Tidyverse to Beginners from David Robinson at rstudio::conf 2018 (video), and here is the blog post and a related post on teaching ggplot2, specifically from David.

Love, Ph.D. Professor of Medicine, Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, CWRU Director of Biostatistics and Evaluation, Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, MetroHealth Medical Center Chief Data Scientist, Better Health Partnership Track Lead for Health Care Analytics, MS in Biostatistics, Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences, CWRU Fellow, American Statistical Association 2.1 A More Complete Biography Hi. I am Thomas E. Love, Ph.D. and I have at least three different jobs. I am a Professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population &amp; Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University. I teach three courses per year there (PQHS 431, 432 and 500) and also lead the Health Care Analytics track of the MS program in Biostatistics. I direct Biostatistics and Evaluation at the Center for Health Care Research &amp; Policy, which is a joint venture of CWRU and MetroHealth Medical Center. For ten years, I was the (founding) Data Director for Better Health Partnership, an alliance of people who provide, pay for and receive care in Northeast Ohio. I now serve as Chief Data Scientist there. I am a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, and have won numerous awards for my teaching and my research, including the 2018 John S. Diekhoff Award for Graduate Teaching from CWRU. I have been teaching at CWRU since 1994, and have taught every manner of CWRU student over the years, especially students in biostatistics, medicine, and management. In research, I use statistical methods to look at questions in health policy and in particular the provision of health services. I mostly work with observational data, rather than data that emerge from randomized clinical trials, and I have a special interest in working with data from electronic health records. You may be interested in a recent study in Health Affairs showing the impact of a Medicaid-like expansion plan on care and outcomes of poor patients in Cleveland. Or you might be interested in our New England Journal of Medicine study of the effect of electronic health records on the care and outcomes of people with diabetes. In 2011, James O’Malley and I chaired the Ninth International Conference on Health Policy Statistics, here in Cleveland. Here’s a recap. I’ve also worked on many projects involving the use of propensity scores to make causal inferences from observational studies, particularly in heart failure. If you want to see a pretty complete list of my publications, knock yourself out. I hold degrees from Columbia University in the City of New York and from the University of Pennsylvania. My dissertation adviser was Paul Rosenbaum. I am married to a brilliant woman who is an attorney at GE Lighting, and we are raising two terrific sons, one in college (University of Pittsburgh), and one finishing high school this year. I live in Shaker Heights. I also sing and act occasionally in community theater. 2.2 Email Email to get help with the course: 431-help at case dot edu (seen by Professor Love and the TAs) Thomas dot Love at case dot edu (for matters related to grades or individual concerns) Professor Love is hard to reach by phone. Email is always the best way to reach him. 2.3 Offices Wood WG-82J on the ground floor of the Wood building (Tuesdays and Thursdays) Rammelkamp R-229A at MetroHealth Medical Center (Wednesdays and Fridays) Professor Love is available for the 15 minutes before and the 30 minutes after each class, and otherwise by appointment on Tuesdays and Thursdays (send email to schedule). 2.4 Name and Pronouns Professor Love uses he/him/his pronouns. Most students refer to him either as Professor Love or Dr. Love. He prefers his given name to be written “Thomas” as opposed to “Tom”. Most of his friends and colleagues call him “Tom”. You are welcome to do so, as well, if that makes you more comfortable. 2.5 Web Professor Love’s GitHub pages website. His GitHub name is THOMASELOVE. His Twitter handle is ThomasELove. "],

You will know a fair amount of R (and some other things, too) after taking the course, though. We’ll also be using the R Markdown tool within RStudio. R Markdown will be taught in our class, and can be used to generate reproducible reports that appear as .html files, PDF files or Word documents, among other things. For some people, working with R is the best part of the class, and the part that they’re most excited about. For others, it’s a real source of anxiety. We understand and encourage patience. There will definitely be some pain, but our experience is that things are much smoother for most people by early October than they appear to be in August. 6.1 System Requirements You will need access to a computer to do your work for this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. Whether or not you want to bring that computer to class is up to you. All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU, so there is nothing to buy in terms of software. We’ve made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course. You will need a computer, either PC or Mac, but the style should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life. In this class, you’ll be using RStudio and R, which look and work the same on either a PC or a Mac. Any reasonably recent PC or Macintosh machine will work well. We do not recommend the use of a Chromebook for this class. R and RStudio also run on Linux systems. If you use one, you know more than Professor Love does about how to accomplish that. 6.2 RStudio Cloud (borrowed in part from Andrew Heiss) R is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure. To make life easier, you can (and should!) use the free RStudio.cloud service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer to get started with R! We will have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that will let you quickly copy templates for some of your work, too. RStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets or more complicated analysis. Over the course of the semester, you’ll probably want to get around to installing R, RStudio, and other R packages on your computer and wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud. This isn’t absolutely necessary (especially early on), but you’ll probably feel the need to have done it by the end of September. 6.3 How Do I Install The Software? We’ve built a Software page on the course website to help with installation and getting started with R. There, you will find specific instructions to install everything you need, specifically: [R] The latest version of the R statistical software. [RStudio] The latest version of the RStudio development environment. [Packages] Some R “packages” of functions, data and documentation. [431 Data] Some data and functions specific to the 431 class. In brief, the steps you need to take for 431 are: Download and install the latest version of R (version 3.6.1 at this writing) at http://cran.case.edu/ or from https://cloud.r-project.org) which automatically chooses a fast, nearby mirror for you. Download and install RStudio (version 1.2.1335 or later at this writing) at https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download. If you prefer, you can run the Preview Version of RStudio to get the very latest features, but that requires you to update your setup more frequently, and, very occasionally, deal with some additional troubleshooting. Install some R packages - an R “package” is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of R, and is the critical way to get R doing interesting work. To install the packages for our course, follow the instructions in [the Packages description at our Software page (to be posted before class begins.) Download the data and code (functions) we’ve developed specifically for this course from our Data and Code page (also to be posted before class begins.) You’ll find complete instructions, with a step-by-step walk through for PC or Mac machines on the Software page. 6.4 Need More Help? If you need more help, you might look at this terrific resource for Installing R and RStudio from Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 project. These are the people responsible for the great Happy Git with R project, which is worth your time, too, if you intend to use Git and GitHub. If you’re having installation problems or problems getting started in R, please consider asking a question of us at 431-help at case dot edu, although a visit to office hours is often more helpful, as it’s difficult for us to diagnose your problem without seeing your computer. There are many, many online resources to help you with working in R, in addition to emailing us at 431-help at case dot edu. An especially useful one is the RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). 6.5 Why do we teach R, instead of SPSS or SAS or whatever, in 431-432? Because it is by far the better choice for what we’re trying to do, which is to help you become effective data scientists. And effective scientists, period. Because being a data scientist means writing code and actually doing (not just talking about) replicable research, which R facilitates in an immense variety of ways. Because R is free to you, me and everyone, and its community is a daily delight. To read comments from other people on the subject, there’s always Google, but I suggest reading Why R? from Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy. Also, the question of “Why R and not SPSS?” was nicely addressed by Greg Snow in this 2010 post at StackOverflow… When talking about user friendlyness of computer software I like the analogy of cars vs. busses: Busses are very easy to use, you just need to know which bus to get on, where to get on, and where to get off (and you need to pay your fare). Cars on the other hand require much more work, you need to have some type of map or directions (even if the map is in your head), you need to put gas in every now and then, you need to know the rules of the road (have some type of drivers licence). The big advantage of the car is that it can take you a bunch of places that the bus does not go and it is quicker for some trips that would require transfering between busses. Using this analogy programs like SPSS are busses, easy to use for the standard things, but very frustrating if you want to do something that is not already preprogrammed. R is a 4-wheel drive SUV (though environmentally friendly) with a bike on the back, a kayak on top, good walking and running shoes in the pasenger seat, and mountain climbing and spelunking gear in the back. R can take you anywhere you want to go if you take time to leard how to use the equipment, but that is going to take longer than learning where the bus stops are in SPSS. "],
["deliverables-expectations-and-assessment.html", "Section 7 Deliverables, Expectations and Assessment 7.1 Grading Breakdown 7.2 Participation 7.3 There are Quizzes. 7.4 Homework assignments 7.5 Course Project", " Section 7 Deliverables, Expectations and Assessment All students are expected to attend all sessions, participate vigorously in class discussions and in group work, complete all individual work in a timely fashion, demonstrate improvement of skills over the term, and perform well on the Quizzes and in the final portfolio presentation. Such a performance is the minimum standard required to receive a grade of B. To receive an A, students are expected to complete all the requirements described above, demonstrate excellent work in both the final portfolio presentation, and outstanding work in at least one of the following: [a] in class participation, [b] assignments, [c] quizzes. 7.1 Grading Breakdown Grading standards apply in the same way for all students, regardless of whether they are enrolled in PQHS 431, CRSP 431 or MPHP 431. The courses are identical. The course grade is based on four key areas of demonstrated accomplishment. The planned breakdown is as follows, but Professor Love may make adjustments as the semester progresses, especially once we’re sure about the numbers of Homeworks and Quizzes through the term. Weight Task 15% In-Class and Outside-of-Class Participation 25-35% Completion and Quality of Homework 20-30% Performance on Quizzes 30% Performance on Project Work Any questions regarding how you are doing in the course should be directed to Professor Love alone. In particular, the TAs do not have full access to the final grades. Regarding the Homework, Dr. Love will drop your lowest score before calculating your grade in the course. So you can miss one Homework over the course of the semester with no explanation. Note that this doesn’t apply to the Quizzes or to any element of the Project. 7.2 Participation I cannot emphasize enough how much we want to hear from you about things that are relevant to this course. If you’re not shy, ask questions in class. The TAs help me assess participation, so they are paying attention, too. Come to the TA office hours if you need help. Make an appointment to talk to us if you have something to discuss that doesn’t work well in email. Email 431-help at case dot edu. with your questions and comments. That’ll lead to faster answers, typically, and help us recognize you as someone trying to improve their understanding. Find typos in the materials (code, slides, the Notes, this syllabus)? Send them to us at 431-help at case dot edu. See a cool visualization online? A nice use of statistical methods or design in a paper? Share them with us, at 431-help at case dot edu. If we ask you to do something after class (responding to a minute paper survey, for example, which will happen 8-10 times over the course of the term), getting that done in a timely fashion will help your grade in this area. Visit the Teaching Assistants and ask them questions about the course, or things you’re having trouble with. Talk to Professor Love about your questions/comments/concerns. Make sure he knows who you are - which can be challenging with such a large group. 7.3 There are Quizzes. Each Quiz will be taken online, exclusively. Details on the Quizzes are found at the Course website’s Quizzes page. If you need to make alternate arrangements for a Quiz, please contact Professor Love via email as soon as possible, at least a week before a Quiz is released. 7.3.1 About the Quizzes Quizzes typically involve 25-40 questions. The questions are not arranged in any particular order, and you should answer all questions. All questions involve relatively short responses, sometimes after working through a detailed analysis. You will have the opportunity to edit your responses after completing the Quiz, but this must be completed by the deadline. You are welcome (even encouraged) to consult the materials provided on the course website, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on the Quizzes with anyone other than Professor Love or the teaching assistants. We do not guarantee to answer questions we receive via email less than 3 hours prior to the Quiz submission deadline. Quizzes that are more than ten minutes late will not be accepted, except in truly remarkable circumstances. An answer sketch for each Quiz will be made available within 48 hours of the deadline. Grades for the Quizzes are usually available within 48 hours of the deadline. If you feel Professor Love has made an error in grading your Quiz, please let him know directly, by email, as soon as possible. 7.4 Homework assignments There are several homeworks scheduled, and described in detail on the Homework page of our web site. Most require straightforward demonstrations of mastery for core principles and fundamental skills. Some require deeper dives into more technically sophisticated material. Some also require reflection, particularly based on materials we’ll be reading throughout the semester, especially from Nate Silver’s book. 7.4.1 How do the Homeworks work? Almost every Homework will require you to analyze some data, and prepare a report using R Markdown. You will submit both your Markdown file, and an HTML document built using RStudio from that Markdown file. Several Homeworks will require you to write an essay. After Homework A, essays must be composed as part of your Markdown file, and thus included in your HTML document. Do not edit the result of your R Markdown conversion into Word. When writing in English, use complete sentences, rather than bullet points. Clearly mark each Question in each Homework. There is no need to repeat the question before answering it, although you are welcome to do so. Read and heed the advice of Jeff Leek in The Elements of Data Analytic Style. Chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13 of that book are especially relevant to our early assignments. You are welcome to discuss each Homework with anyone, including Professor Love, the teaching assistants, or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. We especially encourage you to take advantage of TA office hours and email 431-help at case dot edu. In general, we do not guarantee to provide answers to questions that we receive in the last 18 hours before a Homework is due, especially once we’ve gotten into mid-September. So don’t leave anything until the last day. Allow time for computer problems. Failure to turn in a Homework within one hour of the deadline will result in a very poor grade on the Homework when it is (eventually) turned in, and a zero (from which it can be difficult to recover) if it is not turned in. Submission of timely, partial work is usually better than no submission at all. Things happen. Dr. Love drops your worst Homeworks grade of the semester before calculating your grade. So if some disaster occurs and you have to miss a deadline, just submit a note saying that this Homework is the one you’ll skip. No need for any explanation. If you need to miss more than one, though, you will need to discuss that with Dr. Love, in advance. Grades on Homeworks are usually available one week after the submission deadline. If you have a complaint about your grade on a Homework, please first review the Grade Appeal Policy at the end of this syllabus. 7.4.2 Where do I turn in the Homeworks? For the most part, you’ll do this using the Canvas system at https://canvas.case.edu. The course’s primary listing is PQHS 431, but students in CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for each Homework will appear in time for you to submit the work, usually just after the deadline for the preceding Homework has passed. 7.5 Course Project The course project is a major part of the course. Materials related to the project will be posted to the Course Website’s Project page which will update frequently through the semester. The project includes tasks you’ll complete throughout the semester, culminating in a final presentation to Professor Love of your work in mid-December. For deadlines, see the Course Calendar. "],

So you’ll need to take advantage of every opportunity you have to write more effectively tomorrow than you do today. Here’s what I find to be a compelling argument from George Cobb … If you want your work with data to make a difference, devote time and effort to choosing the words and pictures you use to present your evidence and conclusions. If you teach or supervise, seek to reward those - they who learn from you, and they who report to you – when they spend time crafting their message. Think back to the last “report” you were expected to read. Is it easy to recall the main points? The answer, yes or no, depends not so much on the quality of the data, the effort, and the thinking that went into the report, nor on your own dutiful diligence in reading the report, but rather, and mainly, on whether the people who wrote the report had learned and practiced the skills of how to use words and pictures, first, to claim attention, and second, to claim retention: to deliver a message that sticks in the mind. 9.1 On Campus Resource The CWRU Writing Resource Center is definitely a good place to get some help. 9.2 Advice from Other People I Respect Preparing Manuscripts for Submission to Medical Journals: The Paper Trail by H.

Frank Harrell’s Checklist for Authors of Statistical Problems to Document and to Avoid 9.3 A Few Tips from Professor Love Statistics is a “getting the details right” business - we care deeply about details, and this applies to writing code or complete English sentences. RStudio has a spell-checker. To use it, click F7. Nothing impresses us as much as a clear and concise argument, presented using well-written English sentences, effective and well-labeled figures and tables. Don’t parrot back material that Professor Love wrote or said. State ideas in your own words. Stating them in other words is, technically, plagiarism. Edit your more adventurous output; don’t present everything you know how to do in R, and don’t forget that someone is trying to read both your code and your results. Make your work easy to evaluate. In responding to an assignment, be sure to answer the question that was asked, restating it as necessary. Clearly label everything: graphs, tables, your answer to a specific question. Everything. Again, make your work easy to evaluate. Simplify. Emphasize ideas in plain language. Avoid jargon. Use English well. Data are plural. Use “the data are …” rather than ``the data is … ’’ A paragraph must contain more than one sentence. Don’t switch tenses. If you want to write in the present tense, stick to it throughout. Don’t write or say random sample unless you used a random number generator. If you used haphazard sampling or convenience sampling, call it what it is, and indicate whether any problems could have cropped up as a result. Similarly, don’t defend a method of data collection because it is random. Most of the time we want to represent some population, and a random sample is just one way to ensure that certain types of biases have a low probability of creeping in. If you want to write that you used \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) as your significance level, then state that your results were obtained using a 95% confidence level, not a 95% confidence interval, unless you are actually interpreting a confidence interval. If you find yourself in the appalling situation of writing about a p-value, then you should state something like: [1] We’re using a 95% confidence level. [2] We’re using a 5% significance level. or [3] We’re using \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Don’t use more than one of these expressions. Again, don’t use p-values in most settings, but if you must, refer to all p-values that are less than 0.001 or perhaps less than 0.0001 as \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), rather than, for instance, \\(p = 0.00000001\\) or, worse yet, \\(p = 0\\). In a similar vein, write all \\(p\\)-values that exceed 0.99 as \\(p &gt; 0.99\\) instead of, for instance, \\(p = 1\\). To the extent possible, don’t use computer-ese to label variables, plots or tables. R and Markdown allow you to change the labels on graphs and tables to meaningful things – do so. Use meaningful abbreviations, as necessary, explaining what they mean on the first usage. When in doubt, err on the side of clarity. Clear thinking, clear writing. "],
["general-course-policies.html", "Section 10 General Course Policies 10.1 Grade Appeal Policy - Request a Review in December!", " Section 10 General Course Policies Any concerns or questions regarding these general policies, the teaching assistants or the course itself should be directed to Professor Love, if at all possible. All student work is subject to the University’s policies and procedures. Registration is required. I do not permit anyone to audit the course who has not previously taken it, without exception. If you’ve taken the course before and want to sit in again, you will need to volunteer or be hired as a teaching assistant. Grading. Students in this class are not in competition with each other for grades. I have no set percentage of students who will receive any particular grade. Attendance is expected, but it is expected that sometimes life will intervene. If you need to miss two or more classes in a row, inform Professor Love via email beforehand, or as soon as possible thereafter. I will assume you have a good reason - details are not necessary. You are responsible for all missed work, regardless of the reason for your absence. You get to miss one Homework over the course of the semester, with no explanation, as Dr. Love will drop your lowest score across all Homeworks at the end of the semester. With that exception, late work is unacceptable under anything but the most harrowing of circumstances. Professor Love (via email) is the person to discuss this with, prior to the deadline, if you feel your circumstances are sufficiently dire to warrant an exception. In this class, it is far better to turn in timely, but only partially complete work than nothing at all. Feedback on assignments - deadline. On every assignment, Quiz, project-related task, whatever, we will be delighted to respond to email questions up to 18 hours before the assignment is due. After that time, you may wind up on your own. The reason for this is that Professor Love and the teaching assistants will regularly post responses to frequently asked questions about assignments, and we need sufficient time to accomplish this task. On Getting Help Quickly and Effectively: In general, we don’t have a way to diagnose your problem with R, RStudio or Markdown if you don’t show us what you’re typing that causes an error, or a lack of results. If you wrote a Markdown file, we need to see it, along with a specific question (or series of them) about specific error messages or strange results you are getting. We need to replicate the problem in order to know how to fix your problem, and it also helps if we know what error message you’re seeing, or what strange result you are getting. Using a Laptop Using a laptop to follow along, take notes, or try things out during class, can be very helpful. Feel encouraged to do so. Computer You will need access to a computer (PC or Mac - a ChromeBook won’t do) outside of class to do every assignment. You will need to be able to install software on this computer, and update it frequently, although the use of RStudio Cloud may help alleviate this problem a bit. Distractions. Silence your phone during class. The temptation to look at your phone or Facebook or email during class is nearly irresistible. Resist anyway, if only to avoid distracting your instructor and your fellow students. Professor Love has no shame about embarrassing people on this issue. If it’s critical, just step out of the room. Research Usage. Any and all results of in-class and out-of-class assignments and activities are data sources for research and may be used in published research. All such use will always be anonymous. Audio-Recording. It is our intention to provide audio recordings of each class after they are complete. Anything you say during a class session may be audio-recorded. Typos. Professor Love makes occasional typographic and grammatical errors, which irritate him enormously. Please email him if you find any in this syllabus or any other course materials. If you are the first to let us know, and we make the change, you will receive some credit in your class participation grade. Again, all Case Western Reserve University policies apply to this class. To the extent that those policies are unclear, I would regard an appropriate code of conduct as mirroring this one from the R Consortium. 10.1 Grade Appeal Policy - Request a Review in December! For each Homework, we publish a detailed answer sketch and grading rubric. You will also learn your scores on each individual item on each Homework. Clarification of concerns related to potential typographical or other errors in these answer sketches is welcome at any time, but haggling over points on assignments can be a real time sink in a large class. To that end, students are requested not to dispute any grading on Homeworks during the semester, but instead to request a review on a Google Form that will be reviewed by Professor Love in December. On the course’s Homework page, we include a section about Grading Errors and Regrade Requests. There, you’ll find a link to a Google form (you must log into Google via CWRU to see it) listing all of the Homeworks. The form is found at http://bit.ly/431-2019-regrade-requests. Any student who wishes to dispute points can specify the number of points in question for each item, and the details of the issues that concern them. If you wish to dispute a grade, just fill out the form, and Professor Love will review it in December. You can fill out the form at any time, and you can edit the form after submitting it once so that you can add additional requests up until the end of the semester. All forms must be submitted by 2019-12-12 at 12 Noon. Disputing a grade on a homework with a teaching assistant is pointless. Professor Love is responsible for all final grading decisions, and if you have a concern, you should submit your request through the form. Students are welcome to ask questions of Professor Love about grading during the term. The TAs and Professor Love are happy to discuss in a general sense any questions about an assignment, but no grades will be changed until the end of the term. - The one exception is if there is a mistake in adding up points, or some similar clerical error. If you find such an issue, please bring it to Professor Love’s attention via email, and such problems will be corrected immediately, of course. In mid-December, after Professor Love has worked out what letter grade to give each student, he will go through the requests and determine for each whether the student’s letter grade would change if all of the points in dispute were granted. If the answer is no, then he won’t even look at the disputed grade(s). If the answer is yes, then he will look very carefully to see if enough extra points are merited to change a grade. (It will not help your case to submit frivolous requests.) The main advantage of this system is that it saves all of us the hassle of haggling over points that are never going to mean anything anyway. It also provides “equal access” to students who are too timid to approach us in person with their concerns. Finally, if there is an issue with grading a particular problem or assignment that needs to be reconsidered, Professor Love will have access to all papers and can make a universal decision1 I got this idea from Jessica Utts at http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v22n2/rossmanint.pdf.↩ "]
