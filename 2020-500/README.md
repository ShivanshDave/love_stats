# 2020-500

This will be the public web site for my 500 course (Observational Studies) in Spring 2020 at Case Western Reserve University. 

## Where is the syllabus?

You'll find it posted at https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-500-syllabus/. You can read it as an HTML file, or download it as a PDF or Kindle e-pub formatted document.

## What should I do before the first class?

- **Buy the Book**: During the course, we will read Paul Rosenbaum's book **Observation and Experiment: An Introduction to Causal Inference**, which is available as an e-book or in paperback for under $25. Please buy the book and read the Preface and Chapter 1 before our first class on 2020-01-16.
- **Install the Software**: Install R (version 3.6.2 or later) and RStudio (version 1.2.5033 or later) and some necessary R packages. [Details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/software.md).
- **Learn about the course**: Review [the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2020-500-syllabus/), [the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/calendar.md) and the other materials on this site, especially those things relating to:
    - [Homework Assignments](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework), including [Essay Prompts](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/homework/essayprompts.md)
    - [Observational Studies in Action](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia) presentations
    - The [Course Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/project)
    - [Data and R Code for 500](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data) including [The Toy Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/new/master/toy2020) and [The dm2200 Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200)!
    - [R-Basics](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/r-basics): Some Examples in Cleaning Data and Coding Analyses in R designed to help you with this course's assignments. The main PDF here is about 60 pages long, so there's a lot of material to review.

## Any Questions?

- To get help with the course, email Dr. Love and Mr. Persaud at **500-help at case dot edu**.
- Once class begins, Dr. Love will be available on Thursdays from 11 to 11:30 AM for discussion / office hours without an appointment. Should you need to set up an appointment at another time, please contact him via email.
- Dr. Love is available by email at `Thomas dot Love` at `case dot edu`. 
- Teaching Assistant: **Harry Persaud** has agreed to volunteer as a teaching assistant for the course. Harry will be available to answer questions (mostly about coding in R, propensity scores and data management) either in person (by arrangement) or via email. Contact Harry (and Dr. Love) at **500-help at case dot edu**.

## Everything here is under revision.
