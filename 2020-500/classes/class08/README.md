### Prompt for Essay on Rosenbaum Chapter 8 (Quasi-Experimental Devices)

Provide an example of how the method of multiple control groups might be used to improve the design of an observational study with which you are familiar, either one you have been directly involved in, or one you've read about, or one you'd like to be able to do. Provide a basic description of your study's population, outcome, treatment and control conditions and covariates of interest so we can follow your logic. Be sure to specify the approach you would take in implementing multiple control groups, and the ways in which you expect the use of multiple control groups to be helpful in improving your understanding of the phenomenon you're studying. 

- Dr. Love will [post all the essays he has by class time here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class08/essays_chapter8_rosenbaum_2020-03-26.pdf).
- Instructions for discussion...
    - First 5 minutes: Read the essays and select someone to be the reporter.
    - Next 10 minutes: Try to (1) Identify some common goals (things that people were trying to accomplish through implementing multiple control groups.) (2) Identify some common ways people actually implemented multiple groups? Did any approach seem particularly convincing or likely to be useful? 
    - Last 5 minutes: (3) What is the most useful thing we can all learn from the essays you discussed? 
    - Reporter will report out your breakout group's thoughts to Question (3) when you rejoin the main group.

## Announcements

1. Please do not assume we know what you're going through. If you're having trouble with anything related to the course, large or small, please ask.

2. I've had to change the 500 Class Zoom sessions to no longer allow you to sign in before I do. I will open each session at 8:15 Thursday morning, and I will stay on the line until everyone else is gone after class. I made this change in an attempt to speed up the processing of recordings.

3. Today's Slides continue to discuss the topic of Sensitivity Analysis, and attempt to be more practical. I've posted [the sensitivity spreadsheet I built in 2008](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class08/sensitivityspreadsheet_2008.xls) and a [PDF that demonstrates its use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class08/sensitivitydocumentation_2008.pdf). The [Toy Example](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/toy2020-500)'s HTML document may also be of some help if you need to see another example.

4. Homework 5 is cancelled, as you know. I [posted last year's answer sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw5/sketch_hw5). I hope it helps.

5. I added some links to work from other people (including some videos to learn more about propensity scores) to [our 500-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data#some-work-from-other-people).

6. I am not really "looking at COVID-19 data" much, but I [added to our resources list](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) several interesting items recently.

## Examples for Using R to do Propensity Score Analyses

- [The Toy Example (2020 version)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2020) with [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/toy2020-500)
- [The lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) with [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/lindner-500)
- [Propensity Score Matching with the `dm2200` example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) whose [HTML version is on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/dm2200-500)

## Next Week

1. The [Project Update](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/project/02_update) is due Tuesday 2020-03-31 at Noon, via Canvas. Please contact `500-help` if you have any questions or expect a delay.

2. [OSIA speakers next week](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia/claims#papers-to-be-discussed-in-class-on-2020-04-02) are **Laurie Ann and Jesus** (first readers: email slides to your second reader and to me by 3 PM Wednesday 2020-04-01), and then **Sofija and Amin** (second readers: email slides to me by 8 PM Wednesday 2020-04-01.)

3. In addition to OSIA, we'll discuss [Rosenbaum Chapter 9 and your essays](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/homework/essayprompts.md#prompt-for-chapter-9-sensitivity-to-bias) which is about sensitivity to bias, and may clarify some of the issues we've been working on. 
    - Please submit your Essay to Canvas before 7:30 AM on 2020-04-02 so I can share them all with the group.

4. I expect that I'll be talking about instrumental variables either next week or the week after. It would be helpful if, in advance, you read the newspaper article from Whitehouse (2007) below, and perhaps glanced at the two papers.

- Whitehouse Mark 2007 [Is an Economist Qualified to Solve Puzzle of Autism?](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/sources/articles/Whitehouse%202007%20WSJ%20Economics%20and%20Autism.pdf) *Wall Street Journal*
- Landrum Mary Beth and Ayanian John Z 2001 [Causal Effect of Ambulatory Specialty Care on Mortality Following Myocardial Infarction: A Comparison of Propensity Score and Instrumental Variable Analyses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/sources/articles/Landrum%20and%20Ayanian%202001%20Propensity%20Scores%20and%20Instrumental%20Variables.pdf) *Health Services & Outcomes Research Methodology*
- Stukel Therese A. et al. 2007 [Analysis of Observational Studies in the Presence of Treatment Selection Bias: Effects of Invasive Cardiac Management on AMI Survival Using Propensity Score and Instrumental Variable Methods](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/sources/articles/Svanstrom%20et%20al%202013%20main%20manuscript.pdf) *Journal of the American Medical Association*
