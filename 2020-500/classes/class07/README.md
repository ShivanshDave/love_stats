# 500 Class 07: 2020-03-19

## Connecting to Today's Class via Zoom

- The Zoom meetings for our 500 classes will be open from 8:30 AM to 11:30 PM on Thursdays, beginning 2020-03-19.
    - The classes themselves will start at 8:30 and end by 11, but we want to provide some flexibility at the end for students to chat amongst themselves or with Dr. Love.
- **You will need to register in advance for the meeting using the link sent to your email on 2020-03-17 with the subject line "500 Zoom Class Meetings - Please register so that you can attend the classes".** After you register, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the meeting. 
    - As I understand it, once you've done this registration the first time, you should then be able to join the subsequent class meetings without re-registering, and the meetings should appear on your Zoom calendar and can be added to your Google Calendar or other time management tools.
- Before class, be sure you've logged into [Zoom via CWRU](https://case.edu/utech/help/knowledge-base/zoom/zoom-information) and obtained the application for your computer or tablet.

## Plans for the Rest of the Semester

I sent out [this Google Doc on Monday](http://bit.ly/500-next-steps) and I continue to update it as new information emerges. I believe you've all seen it, and thank you for responding.

## Today's Slides

- Today's slides are available in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class07/500-2020-slides_class07.Rmd) and [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class07/500-2020-slides_class07.pdf).
    - They focus on sensitivity analysis after propensity score matching.
    - We'll also walk through the materials on sensitivity analysis contained in the [Toy Example](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/toy2020-500)'s HTML document.
    - I've also provided [the sensitivity spreadsheet I built in 2008](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class07/sensitivityspreadsheet_2008.xls) and a [PDF that demonstrates its use](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class07/sensitivitydocumentation_2008.pdf).
- [Here is the Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OmBgE7I6F2IWDrrJGSaRxpcZa1Y2q00nQek4b5JnSlM/edit?usp=sharing) that I am using during today's class (as needed) to take notes. If something happens in Zoom preventing you from using the chat feature, or you cannot get my attention, try [typing into the document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OmBgE7I6F2IWDrrJGSaRxpcZa1Y2q00nQek4b5JnSlM/edit?usp=sharing).

## Announcements, etc.

1. I've posted some [COVID-19 data and other resources](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md). If you have something you've been following, please let me know and I'll consider adding it to the list.
2. You might also be interested in setting up a web site for yourself. I provided some information on this, thanks largely to Wyatt, as an optional homework assignment for students in the 432 class. You'll [find the materials here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/edit/master/homework/hw06/README.md).
