## Prompt for Essay on Rosenbaum Chapter 9 (Sensitivity to Bias)

In one of Dr. Love's papers using matched propensity-score analysis, a significant result was obtained favoring the treatment group over a control, and the calculated sensitivity parameter value was 1.5. Now imagine that you did a study and obtained such a result. Provide a basic description of your imaginary study's population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic. Provide a description of what that value means in English, and discuss how your reaction to the study and its importance might differ if the significance level was unchanged but the sensitivity parameter had instead been 1.1, or 2.0.

- Dr. Love will [post all the essays he has by class time here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class09/essays_chapter9_Rosenbaum_2020-04-02.pdf).
- Discussion Instructions...
    - First 7-8 minutes: Read the essays and select someone to be the reporter.
    - Next 10-12 minutes: As a group, (1) Identify some common features of the studies you developed. (2) Identify some common ways people tried to describe what the sensitivity parameter (gamma) means in their setting. Did any approach seem particularly clear, useful or helpful? (3) What is the most useful thing we can all learn from the essays you discussed? 
    - Reporter will report out your breakout group's thoughts to Question (3) when you rejoin the main group.
- If possible, let's have different people reporting than did last time. OK?

## What Will Dr. Love Discuss Today?

1. [Project Presentation Plan](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/project/presentation_plan.md)
2. Strength of Evidence vs. Quality of Question, as motivated by this [2019 blog post from Roger Peng](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/04/17/tukey-design-thinking-and-better-questions/)
3. Specific Issues Motivated by [The Project Updates](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/project/2020_projects.md)
4. The [Right Heart Catheterization Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc2020)

## Announcements

1. I [added more items to the COVID-19 resources list](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) since we last met.
    - In 432 today, I'll discuss the [IHME (University of Washington) COVID-19 Projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections) a bit, and in particular, I'm going to use [some of these tweets from Carl T. Bergstrom](https://twitter.com/CT_Bergstrom/status/1244815009303023616?s=20) to motivate our discussion, and try to help you spread the word to people who haven't caught on to the distinction between the UW model and other models (like the initial Imperial College projections - see [Report 9 here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/).) You folks can probably get by just reading through the tweets, I expect.
    - You may be interested in [this webinar series](https://statds.org/events/webinar_dsa2020/index.html) which "aims to promptly
disseminate the newest data science methods, tools, and findings in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, facilitate the exchange of
research ideas, and engage collaborations between data scientists and field experts worldwide to solve the COVID-19 crisis."

2. I found Dylan Small's talk as part of the new [Online Causal Inference Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/ocis/) very interesting (for the first 20 minutes until I had to join another call) and a recording is available.

3. Remember, most of us are not working from home, we are at our home during a crisis trying to work. Harry and I would like to help you. If you have questions or need some help, please let us know.

## Next Week

1. [OSIA speakers next week](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia/claims#papers-to-be-discussed-in-class-on-2020-04-09) are **Jason and Joseph** (first readers: email slides to your second reader and to me by 3 PM Wednesday 2020-04-08), and then **Amy and Wyatt** (second readers: email slides to me by 8 PM Wednesday 2020-04-08.)

2. In addition to OSIA, we'll discuss [Rosenbaum Chapter 10 and 11 and your essays](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/homework/essayprompts.md#prompt-for-chapter-10-design-sensitivity) which are about design sensitivity (Chapter 10) and matching techniques (Chapter 11.) 
    - Please feel free to submit an Essay for either Chapter 10 or 11, in either case before 7:30 AM on 2020-04-09 so I can share them all with the group.

3. We will discuss instrumental variables next week and the week after. It would be helpful if, in advance, you read the newspaper article from Whitehouse (2007) below, and perhaps glanced at the two papers.
