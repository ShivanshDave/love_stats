# 500 Class 02: 2020-01-23

## Today's Slides

- The slides I'll present in class today are [available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class02/500_2020_slides02.pdf) as well as [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class02/500_2020_slides02.Rmd).
- Audio recordings of our classes will be maintained in [this Google Drive folder](http://bit.ly/500-2020-audio).

## Announcements, etc.

1. Today we'll discuss Lucy D'Agostino McGowan's [February 2017 blog post](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/hill-data-scientist-xkcd-story.html) "[Causation or Correlation: Explaining HIll Criteria using `xkcd`](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/hill-data-scientist-xkcd-story.html)."
    - It was inspired by Roger Peng and Hilary Parker's [Not So Standard Deviations podcast, Episode 28](http://nssdeviations.com/episode-28-writing-is-a-lot-harder-than-just-talking).
2. I want to spend a few minutes today describing [The Toy Example (2020 version), found here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2020). We will walk through the example in Class 4 (and perhaps a bit of the surrounding classes, as well.)
3. I'll also spend some time discussing [The dm2200 Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) which will help you with propensity matching, in particular, and may be a somewhat less daunting starting place.

## After today's class, you should be moderately well-equipped to:

1. Do [Homework 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw2), again with some help from the [r-basics](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/r-basics) page or from [Homework 0](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw0) or from [the sketch we'll post for Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw1). If that fails, and googling doesn't help, email us at **500-help at case dot edu**.
2. Get rolling on identifying a good data set and start working in earnest on your [Project Proposal](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/project). 
3. Identify at least one good article using propensity scores that you want to read for your [Observational Studies in Action](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia) assignment. The [list of "claimed" articles is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia/claims).
4. Read Chapter 3 of Rosenbaum, in anticipation of our discussion next time. Were I you, I'd continue on to read through Chapter 4 if you have the time.
5. Look over the start of the [Toy Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2020) and/or [the dm2200 Example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) to see what's ahead of you.
