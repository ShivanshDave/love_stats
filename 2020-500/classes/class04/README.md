# 500 Class 04: 2020-02-13

## Today's Slides

- There are no slides today. Our focus today is:
    - using R to do propensity score analysis, and 
    - a discussion of Chapters 4, 5 and 6 from Rosenbaum,
    - discussing your planned [Observational Studies in Action](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia/claims),
    - discussing your [initial drafts of your project proposals](http://bit.ly/500-proposal-initial-drafts).
- Audio recordings of our classes will be maintained in [this Google Drive folder](http://bit.ly/500-2020-audio).

## Examples for Using R to do Propensity Score Analyses

- [The Toy Example (2020 version)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2020) with [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/toy2020-500)
- [Propensity Score Matching with the `dm2200` example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) with [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/dm2200-500)
- [The lindner example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/lindner) with [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/lindner-500)

## Rosenbaum, Chapters 4, 5 and 6

4. Irrationality and Polio
    - The nature of preferences (Can a preference be irrational?) and Kahneman \& Tversky
    - Randomized Evaluation of the Salk Vaccine
    - Why was the RCT (Plan B) a better choice than Plan A (vaccinate grade 2, let 1 and 3 serve as controls)?
5. Between Observational and Experimental
    - Cochran's definition of an observational study
    - "Randomization on the basis of a covariate" experiments
    - Key Insight: Combining Strata with the Same Pr(Treatment)
    - What is the most important thing to remember about the propensity score?
    - When is it enough to adjust for observed covariates?
6. Natural Experiments
    - Some examples of natural experiments (attempts to find in the world a situation with some of the attributes of an experiment)
    - What does it mean for treatment assignment to be ignorable?

- What was the most important thing that you learned from reading these chapters?
- What was the muddiest, least clear thing that arose in your reading?
- What questions are at the front of your mind now?

## Announcements, etc.

1. All students have [successfully claimed an OSIA article](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia/claims). We'll determine who will be "second reader" for each article as soon as possible.
2. Your initial drafts of the project proposal were due Wednesday at noon. Dr. Love [has started to compile a spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/500-proposal-initial-drafts), and we'll us it in our discussion today. Visit http://bit.ly/500-proposal-initial-drafts for additional follow-up after class.
3. The [Homework 2 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw2#answer-sketch) has been posted for some time now. [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw3) is now due on 2020-02-20 at 3 PM.
4. Next time, in a change of the original schedule, we will continue our work on using R to do propensity score analysis, but we will also be reading and discussing [Rubin 2001](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/sources/articles/Rubin%202001%20Tobacco%20Litigation%20article.pdf) on the tobacco litigation.
