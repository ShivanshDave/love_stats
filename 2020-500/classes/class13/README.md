- There will be no public recording of Class 13. I'll send the recording via email.
- The [Google Doc of Notes During Class](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OmBgE7I6F2IWDrrJGSaRxpcZa1Y2q00nQek4b5JnSlM/edit?usp=sharing) is a place for you to communicate with Dr. Love and the rest of us (and for Dr. Love to remind himself of things) during class, especially if you cannot connect to the Zoom Chat. 
- [COVID-19 Resources Page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-432/blob/master/covid19resources.md) has some new material since we last spoke together.
