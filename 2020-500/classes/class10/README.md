## Prompt for Chapter 10 (Design Sensitivity)

Describe an example from your own experience (or use your imagination, as needed) that can be modified to reduce sensitivity to unmeasured bias, either by restricting the comparison groups to more intensive receipt or lack of receipt of treatment, or by identifying a subgroup of subjects who are likelier to exhibit a treatment effect. As usual, provide a basic description of your imaginary study's population, outcome, treatment and covariates so we can follow your logic.

People who wrote about [Chapter 10](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class10/Chapter_10_Essays.pdf): Weichuan, Joseph, Jason, Laurie Ann, Amin

## Prompt for Chapter 11 (Matching Techniques)

Describe the most important thing (or things) that you learned from reading Chapter 11 that you didn't already know from our in-class discussions of matching. In particular, specify how this new material might change your approach to your future work, ideally in the context of an actual study you're doing (perhaps your project) or a study you hope to do in the future.

People who wrote about [Chapter 11](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class10/Chapter_11_Essays.pdf): Amy, Wyatt, Sofija, Joshua, Jesus, Morgan

- Here are the [Chapter 10 Essays](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class10/Chapter_10_Essays.pdf) and the [Chapter 11 Essays](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class10/Chapter_11_Essays.pdf) that I have.
- Breakout Discussion Instructions...
    - First 5 minutes: Read the essays and select someone to be the reporter.
    - Next 10 minutes for those looking at **Chapter 10**: (1) Identify any common characteristics of your proposals to reduce sensitivity to unmeasured bias. Did any approach seem particularly effective, or clever? (2) Were there any common points of confusion that emerged in reading Chapter 10?
    - Next 10 minutes for those looking at **Chapter 11**: (1) Identify any common or clever lessons learned from Chapter 11. (2) Discuss any common points of confusion that emerged in reading Chapter 11. 
    - Last 5 minutes: What is the most useful thing we can all learn from your discussion? 
    - Reporter will report out your breakout group's thoughts to Question (3) when you rejoin the main group.
- If possible, try to have the reporter be someone who's not reported previously.

- The slides our speakers will discuss today [are stored in this PDF file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class10/osia_slides_2020-04-09.pdf)

## Next Week

1. OSIA speakers next week are **Sofija and Morgan** (first readers: email slides to your second reader and to me by 3 PM Wednesday 2020-04-15), and then **Joseph and Joshua** (second readers: email slides to me by 8 PM Wednesday 2020-04-15.)

2. Amy and Wyatt will give their project presentations on 2020-04-16, so their Pre-Presentation abstract and slides are due Wednesday 2020-04-15 at 9 AM.

3. Please read Chapter 12 of Rosenbaum for next week and complete your essay, submitting it by 7:30 AM on 2020-04-16.

4. On 2020-04-23, Dr. Love will discuss [Posner et al.](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/sources/articles/Posner%20et%20al%202001%20Comparing%20Methods%20in%20a%20Mammography%20Study.pdf) which I'd like you to skim before that class.

5. [Great Looking Tables](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/04/08/great-looking-tables-gt-0-2/) are now much easier to create than in the past. If you ever need to make beautiful customized display tables, I think youâ€™ll find `gt` is up to the task. [The `gt` website is here](https://gt.rstudio.com/) with lots of examples and a description of the philosophy, and links to other ways to solve table-making problems with other R packages.
