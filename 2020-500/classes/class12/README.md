## Announcements

1. Paul Rosenbaum's [Fisher Lecture is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=JzanvYcgN5Y&feature=emb_logo). 
    - Paul starts speaking 32 minutes in, and discusses (in particular) fine balance and design sensitivity and sensitivity analyses.
    - The observational study Paul discusses: [Silber et al 2007 *J Clin Oncology* is available here](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO.2006.08.2933).
    - Paul also has a [Learn to do a sensitivity analysis Shiny app](https://rosenbap.shinyapps.io/learnsenShiny/)!
2. An excellent explanation of [difference in differences estimation](https://diff.healthpolicydatascience.org/) including some nice material on related methods, including synthetic controls, from Bret Zedlow and Laura Hatfield, as well as [several other contributors](https://diff.healthpolicydatascience.org/#acknowledgments).
    - I like [this video by Doug McKee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7q2H8aB8bQ). 
    - [There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRrjU4kKyzY) are [lots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO7MKhud-y0) of [similar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpWQlHapifU) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJoMEqVRk2I) [online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFqFH97bDy4).
3. Folks had questions about template matching. Here's a paper by folks at Penn from 2014 on [Template Matching for Auditing Hospital Cost and Quality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4213044/) which I think is worth your time.
4. The biggest gap in this course is probably the minimal use of Bayesian methods. Here's Frank Harrell's [Introduction to Bayes for Evaluating Treatments](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bayes/course.html).
5. Frank Harrell's [datamethods discussion forum](https://discourse.datamethods.org) has a great discussion about Language for communicating frequentist results about treatment effects.
    - Another discussion you might find interesting there is [this one on Propensity Score Matching vs. Multivariable Regression](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/propensity-score-matching-vs-multivariable-regression/2319) which contains some strong opinions that I don't hold (and that I do hold) about the relative attractiveness of various strategies for dealing with observational data.
6. I'm posting the edited project evaluations (combining your comments and mine) as PDF files in a folder in our shared Google Drive. You probably received notification of this on Tuesday evening. You might check to see that you can see the ones for Wyatt and Amy, and let me know if there's some problem. Eventually, similar files will appear for each of the 11 presentations.
7. Last night, I corrected a typo in Section 16 of [the Right Heart Catheterization example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/rhc2020) where I'd written with replacement, when it should have read without. Should be fixed now.
