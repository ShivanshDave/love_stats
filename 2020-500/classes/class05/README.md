## Today's Slides

- Today's slides are available in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class05/500-2020-slides05.Rmd) and [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class05/500-2020-slides05.pdf).
    - They focus on what we can learn from [Rubin's 2001 article on the tobacco litigation](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/sources/articles/Rubin%202001%20Tobacco%20Litigation%20article.pdf).
- We'll also spend some time discussing:
    - OSIA articles and "[second readers](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/osia/claims)". I hope you've all completed [the form](https://forms.gle/L8LkRKG2vLZoF71h9).
    - Project Proposals, including [Dr. Love's spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/500-proposal-initial-drafts)
- We'll also spend some meaningful time working through [Propensity Score Matching with the `dm2200` example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/dm2200) whose [HTML version is on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/dm2200-500)
- Audio recordings of our classes will be maintained in [this Google Drive folder](http://bit.ly/500-2020-audio).

## Other Examples for Using R to do Propensity Score Analyses

- [The Toy Example (2020 version)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/500-data/tree/master/toy2020) with [HTML version on RPubs](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/toy2020-500)

## Announcements, etc.

1. [Homework 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/tree/master/homework/hw3) is due today (2020-02-20) at 3 PM. I'll post a sketch as soon as I see that everyone has submitted the assignment to Canvas.
2. In two weeks (remember that we don't have class next week), we'll discuss Rosenbaum Chapter 7 ([be sure to prepare your essay before class](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/homework/essayprompts.md#essay-prompts-for-500)), review any issues with Homeworks 3 and 4, but in the main, we'll focus on methods for Sensitivity Analysis for Matched Samples.
3. I got a great email the other day from Carli Lehr, a physician on staff at the Cleveland Clinic, who took this course last year...

> I wanted to share an article I wrote that was recently accepted using propensity score methodology. This study was a direct result of the project from your PQHS 500 course. This project helped me obtain a grant from the Cleveland Clinic, was featured on Sirius Doctor Radio, and has been used by the Cleveland Clinic Media department to educate our transplant patients (neat study video on this site). 

> Thank you for your patience and time in helping me learn how to think critically about study design and analysis.  

- Here's a [copy of Carli's paper](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/classes/class05/JCVTS_Lehr_2020.pdf), written with her colleagues at CCF.
- The link to the [study video is here](https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2019/12/05/cleveland-clinic-study-using-lungs-from-increased-risk-donors-expands-donor-pool-while-maintaining-current-survival-rates/).

4. I got another email this week from Susan Gross, who took the 431-432 sequence with me a few years ago, and writes...

> I ... am currently using the skills I learned in those courses in my job as a Data Analyst at OverDrive (a Cleveland-based company that sells digital ebooks and audiobooks to libraries). I have the pleasure of working in R all day every day, which is pretty much a dream job for me. I wanted to write to thank you again ... and also to inquire about any outstanding students who would be interested in applying for a full-time entry-level position in Cleveland. I know that any applicants who did well in your 431/432 class and enjoyed the material should do very well in this position. As an aside, the longer this primary season goes, the more interesting [538's Model Talk](https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/model-talk/) gets! I hope you're enjoying it!

- Here's [the link to the Data Analyst position at Overdrive](https://company.overdrive.com/careers/?p=job%2Fo7azbfwL#positions), if you're interested.

- Here is the [FiveThirtyEight Democratic Primary Forecast](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/), if you want to track how last night's debate changes things going forward.
