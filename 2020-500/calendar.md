**Notes**

- The first six classes are primarily devoted to lectures, with occasional demonstrations of R work by Dr. Love. 
- The remaining classes are primarily devoted to discussion of observational studies from the literature, several directed readings, and project work. 
- Throughout the semester, we'll be reading (and, in small groups, you'll be discussing) Paul Rosenbaum's book *Observation and Experiment*.
- The final two classes are primarily devoted to project presentations, and that includes the Thursday of CWRU Finals Week. Students are expected to attend all sessions, but it is particularly important to attend those last two sessions. The official "last day of class" at CWRU this term is 2020-04-27, but we will continue on to 2020-04-30.
- This calendar is designed for a class size of about a dozen students. Should we have substantially more or less, things may change.
- There are homework assignments, an OSIA presentation, and a project in this course. There are no quizzes or examinations.

# COVID NOTE from mid-March

## We live in interesting times. What happens next in 500?

1. Please don't panic. We'll work this out. Please send me an email if you have any questions, or issues you want me to react to when I post a real plan on Monday.
2. I will post a detailed plan for what we'll do next by 6 PM Monday 2020-03-16.
3. The Project Update is still due at noon Thursday 2020-03-19.
4. We will definitely be having class in some kind of virtual way (with no in-person option) from 2020-03-19 through 2020-04-02, and that may be extended all the way to the end of the semester.
5. Whatever that virtual class turns out to be, I will do everything I can to make video and audio recordings available after the sessions.
6. I don't know yet exactly how this will work, or how we'll attack the OSIA work, for example.
