# Homework

## Coding: You'll do **five homework assignments** this semester. 

- All deadlines are provided on [the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2020-500/blob/master/calendar.md). 
- All homework assignments should be submitted to [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/).

These mostly require you to do some analyses (using R and R Markdown) on realistic but not real data I will provide. These are ungraded for quality - just for completion, and give you an opportunity to practice or develop coding skills in a low-stakes environment.

### The "Homework 0" Example

Those of you needing a refresher in coding in R or in developing a logistic regression model, check out the Homework 0 example, which isn't for you to do, but is a worked example for you to use in formulating your responses to some of the later Homeworks.
